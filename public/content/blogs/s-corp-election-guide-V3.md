# S-Corp Election: Is It Right for Your Business?

Last year, you made $150K as a consultant.  
This year, you'll pay $22,950 in self-employment taxes.

With S-Corp election, that drops to $10,710—a gross savings of $12,240. After accounting for S-Corp administration costs (~$7,500/year), you'll net around **$4,700 in annual savings**.

Not life-changing, but not nothing either.

If you're operating as a sole proprietor or standard LLC with **$150K+ in net profit**, you're potentially leaving $5K-$20K on the table every year after costs. At $200K+ profit, savings jump to $10K-$25K. Below $100K profit? The savings rarely justify the complexity.

Here's everything you need to know to make an informed decision—including when S-Corp is NOT the answer.

## ⏱️ TL;DR - The 60-Second Version

**What is S-Corp?** A tax election that lets you split income between salary (taxed) and distributions (not subject to SE tax). Saves 15.3% SE tax on distributions only.

**Who should elect?** Businesses with $100K+ consistent profit, simple structure (single entity), willing to run monthly payroll.

**Real savings after costs:** $0-$2K at $100K profit | $5K-$10K at $150K profit | $10K-$20K at $200K+ profit

**Who should NOT elect?** Multi-entity structures, variable income, profit under $100K, anyone who thinks it's a magic bullet (it's not).

**Key costs:** ~$7,000-8,000/year (payroll, S-Corp return, bookkeeping, EA support)

**Deadline:** March 15, 2026 for 2026 election. Miss it? Late election relief is available (see below).

**Bottom line:** S-Corp solves ONE problem—self-employment tax on distributions. That's it. Income tax stays the same. Not simpler. Not for everyone.

## What Is S-Corp Election? Understanding S-Corporation Tax Status

First, let's clear up confusion:

**An S-Corp is not a business entity.** It's a **tax election**. You're still an LLC or corporation. You're just choosing to be taxed differently.

**Without S-Corp election:**
- Single-member LLC = Taxed as sole proprietor
- Multi-member LLC = Taxed as partnership
- Corporation = Taxed as C-Corp (double taxation)

**With S-Corp election:**
- Your LLC or corporation is taxed as an S-Corporation
- You become an employee of your own business
- You split your income between salary and distributions
- **Distributions are not subject to self-employment tax**

That last bullet is the entire reason S-Corp exists. It saves self-employment (SE) tax. That's it.

---

## What S-Corp Actually Solves (And What It Doesn't)

**S-Corp solves ONE problem: self-employment tax on distributions.**

That's it. It doesn't:
- ❌ Reduce your income tax (same tax bracket, same deductions)
- ❌ Protect assets better than an LLC (same liability protection)
- ❌ Make accounting simpler (opposite—it's MORE complex)
- ❌ Solve cash flow problems (you still owe taxes on profit)
- ❌ Help you raise capital (actually makes it harder)
- ❌ Work for passive income (rental income, investments aren't subject to SE tax anyway)

**It's a specialized tool for one specific tax situation.** Don't elect S-Corp because "successful businesses are S-Corps." Elect because the math works for your specific situation.

## S-Corp Tax Savings: The Real Math

Let's use real numbers—including costs.

![Financial calculator and tax documents](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554224311-beee4ece91fa?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop&q=80)
*Understanding S-Corp tax savings requires looking at the complete financial picture*

### Scenario: LLC Taxed as Sole Proprietor

**Net profit:** $120,000  
**Self-employment tax (15.3%):** $16,956  
**Federal income tax (24% bracket):** ~$17,000  
**Total taxes:** ~$33,956

### Scenario: Same Business, S-Corp Election

**Reasonable salary:** $70,000  
**Distributions:** $50,000

**Payroll taxes on salary (15.3%):** $10,710  
**Federal income tax:** ~$17,000 (same)  
**Payroll taxes on distributions:** $0  
**Gross savings:** $6,246

**But wait—what about costs?**

**S-Corp annual costs:**
- S-Corp tax return (Form 1120-S): $1,500-2,000
- Payroll service: $600-1,200
- Additional bookkeeping: $500-800
- Professional guidance: $1,500-2,500

**Total annual cost: $4,100-6,500**

**Net savings after costs: $0-$2,100/year**

Still worth it? Maybe. Not the $6,246 you thought? Definitely not. **This is why the $100K+ profit threshold matters.**

---

## When Does S-Corp Election Make Sense?

### ✅ You're a Good Candidate If:

**1. Your net profit is consistently over $100K/year**  
Below $100K, the administrative costs ($7,000-8,000/year) often outweigh the tax savings. Between $100K-$120K, it's breakeven territory—worth considering if you expect growth. Above $120K, it starts making clear financial sense.

**2. You're in a service-based business with simple structure**  
Consultants, **healthcare providers**, attorneys, accountants, designers, coaches—anyone selling expertise from a single operating entity.

**3. You're already profitable and expect to stay that way**  
S-Corp doesn't make sense for startups burning cash or businesses with highly variable income.

**4. You're willing to run payroll consistently**  
You'll need to pay yourself via W-2 every month, which means [payroll setup](/services), quarterly 941s, and year-end W-2s. No skipping months.

**5. You understand you're only saving SE tax**  
If you think S-Corp will cut your total tax bill in half, pump the brakes. Income tax stays the same. You're only saving 15.3% on distributions.

*The right business structure depends on your specific situation*

## When S-Corp Is NOT the Answer

You probably should NOT elect S-Corp if:

### ❌ 1. Your Net Profit Is Under $100K Consistently

The math doesn't work. Let's prove it:

**At $80K net profit:**
- Reasonable salary: $55K
- Distributions: $25K
- SE tax savings on $25K: $3,825
- S-Corp costs: $7,000
- **NET RESULT: LOSING $3,175/year**

You'd be paying $3,175 extra just for the privilege of having an S-Corp.

### ❌ 2. You Have Highly Variable Income

Bad year with $60K profit? You still owe payroll taxes on your salary, even if the business barely broke even. S-Corp works best with *predictable* profit.

**Example:** You set salary at $70K expecting $150K profit. Actual profit = $80K. You're paying payroll taxes on $70K salary from only $80K total profit. That hurts.

### ❌ 3. You Operate Multiple Entities (See Next Section)

Unless you have one clearly dominant entity generating $200K+, the complexity may not be worth it. Multi-entity S-Corp structures are a completely different animal.

### ❌ 4. You Don't Understand WHY You're Doing It

If your only reasoning is "my buddy said I should," stop. You need to understand:
- How reasonable salary works
- Why distributions aren't subject to SE tax (but ARE subject to income tax)
- What compliance looks like
- The specific dollar amount you'll save after costs

### ❌ 5. You're Planning to Sell the Business Soon

S-Corp can complicate business sales. Built-in gains, basis adjustments, and buyer preferences matter. Talk to your M&A advisor first.

### ❌ 6. You Want to Retain Earnings Long-Term

S-Corps are pass-through—you're taxed on profit whether you take it out or not. If you're reinvesting heavily and not taking distributions, you'll pay tax on phantom income.

### ❌ 7. Your Business Is Real Estate Rental Income

Rental income isn't subject to SE tax anyway. S-Corp adds complexity with zero benefit.

### ❌ 8. You're a 1099 Contractor Maxing Retirement Contributions

Solo 401(k) contribution limits can be better as a sole prop in some cases. Run the numbers first with your EA.

**The Real Question:** Are you electing S-Corp because you understand the specific tax savings for YOUR situation, or because someone told you it's what successful businesses do?

If it's the latter, let's run your actual numbers first.


![Complex organizational chart](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165804606-c3d57bc86b40?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop&q=80)
*Multi-entity structures add significant complexity to S-Corp elections*
---

## Multi-Entity Structures: When S-Corp Gets Complicated

**S-Corp is NOT an automatic choice when you have multiple operating entities.**

If you operate several LLCs (common in real estate, multi-location practices, or holding company structures), S-Corp election gets complex fast—and may not be worth it.

### The Complications:

**1. Which entity elects S-Corp status?**
- Operating company? Holding company? All of them?
- Each entity = separate S-Corp election + separate payroll + separate Form 1120-S
- **Example:** 3 entities = 3 payrolls, 3 S-Corp returns, 3 reasonable compensation analyses

**2. Reasonable salary allocation gets messy**
- If you work across 3 entities, how do you split your salary?
- IRS wants to see salary from each entity where you provide substantial services
- Multiple W-2s from your own entities raises audit flags
- **Example:** You work 40% in Entity A, 40% in Entity B, 20% in Entity C. Do you split salary 40/40/20? What if Entity C lost money?

**3. Administrative burden multiplies**
- 1 S-Corp: $7,000/year in costs
- 3 S-Corps: $15,000-20,000/year in costs
- **At what point does the complexity outweigh the savings?**

**4. Inter-company transactions require documentation**
- Management fees between entities need written agreements
- Related-party transactions are IRS audit triggers
- Sloppy inter-company accounting = major problems
- **Example:** Entity A "pays" Entity B for services. Without proper documentation, IRS may disallow the deduction.

**5. Cost allocation nightmares**
- Shared expenses (rent, utilities, admin staff) must be allocated across entities
- Requires detailed timesheets, usage logs, and allocation methods
- One mistake = entire structure at risk in audit

### When Multi-Entity S-Corp DOES Make Sense:

✅ **Single high-profit entity** ($200K+) with passive holding companies  
✅ **Clear operational separation** (different services, different clients, no shared expenses)  
✅ **You're willing to invest in proper structure** (legal agreements, clean books, detailed allocation)  
✅ **You have professional accounting support** managing the complexity

### When to Keep It Simple:

❌ Multiple small entities (each under $150K profit)  
❌ Entities with significant related-party transactions  
❌ Entities with shared expenses that are hard to allocate  
❌ You're not ready for the compliance overhead  
❌ Your current accountant isn't experienced with multi-entity S-Corp structures

**Bottom line for multi-entity structures:** This needs *custom analysis*, not a one-size-fits-all S-Corp election. 

We'll help you model which entities (if any) should elect S-Corp status. Sometimes the answer is "none of them." Sometimes it's "just one." Rarely is it "all of them."

## The "Reasonable Salary" Question

Here's where business owners get nervous:

**The IRS requires you to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" before taking distributions.**

Too low of a salary = audit risk.  
Too high = you're not maximizing savings.

So what's "reasonable"?

**The IRS looks at:**
- What similar positions earn in your industry
- Your role and responsibilities in the business
- Time spent working
- Business profitability

**General guidelines for single-entity businesses:**
- **$60K-$80K** for most service-based businesses in the $120K-$150K profit range
- **$80K-$120K** if you're the primary revenue generator and profit is $200K+
- **$50K-$70K** if you have other team members doing the work and you're more of an owner/manager

**Quick test:** Could you hire someone to do your job for this salary? If yes, it's probably reasonable.

We've helped dozens of South Florida clients navigate IRS audits on reasonable compensation. With proper documentation, it's rarely an issue.

## The Real Costs of S-Corp Status (Full Transparency)

Let's be completely transparent about what this actually costs:

### Setup Costs (One-Time)

**DIY Route:**
- Form 2553 (S-Corp election): Free
- State filings (varies): $0-$500

**With Professional Help:**
- EA or attorney setup: $500-$1,500
- Includes election filing, EIN, state registrations

### Ongoing Annual Costs (The Reality)

**Payroll:**
- **Payroll service** (Gusto, ADP, etc.): $600-$1,200/year
- Quarterly 941 filings: Usually included in payroll service

**Tax Preparation:**
- S-Corp tax return (Form 1120-S): $1,500-$2,500
- Significantly more complex than Schedule C
- Requires someone experienced with S-Corps

**Accounting & Bookkeeping:**
- Proper [bookkeeping](/services) (separating salary vs. distributions, maintaining basis, tracking shareholder loans): $500-$1,000/year
- Monthly reconciliation: $200-$500/year
- Year-end compliance: $500-$1,000

**Professional Guidance:**
- Reasonable compensation analysis: $500-$1,000/year
- Quarterly check-ins with EA: $1,000-$2,000/year

**Total realistic annual cost: $7,000-$8,000/year**

Not the $1,500-$3,500 you see advertised. That's DIY pricing with no professional support—and when the IRS comes knocking, you'll wish you had it.

### Break-Even Analysis (Real Numbers)

**You need to save at least $7,000/year in SE tax for S-Corp to break even.**

- $7,000 savings = $45,750 in distributions (at 15.3% SE tax rate)
- Typical salary for that level: $60,000
- **Total profit needed: $105,750** (rounded to **~$100K minimum**)

Below $100K profit, you're probably losing money on S-Corp after costs.

## Real Client Example: Solo Dentist ($280K Profit)

**Client:** Solo dentist in private practice  
**Structure before:** Single-member LLC (taxed as sole prop)  
**Net profit:** $280,000/year

**Taxes before S-Corp:**
- Self-employment tax: $37,000  
- Income tax: ~$52,000  
- **Total: $89,000**

**After S-Corp election:**
- Reasonable salary: $150,000  
- Self-employment tax on salary: $22,950  
- Distributions: $130,000 (no SE tax)  
- Income tax: ~$52,000 (same)  
- **Gross tax savings: $14,050**

**S-Corp costs: $7,500/year** (includes accounting, payroll, S-Corp return, reasonable compensation analysis, EA support)

**Net benefit: $6,550/year**

Over 10 years? **$65,500** in tax savings. Not the $215,000 headline number—that's gross savings without subtracting costs.

Still meaningful? Absolutely. But let's be realistic about the numbers.

---

## Understand This Before You Apply

Before you elect S-Corp, answer these questions honestly:

### S-Corp Readiness Checklist

☐ **Is my net profit over $100K consistently?** (Not one good year—*consistently*)

☐ **Do I understand S-Corp only saves self-employment tax, not income tax?**

☐ **Am I willing to run payroll every single month, no exceptions?**

☐ **Do I have (or can I afford) professional accounting support?**

☐ **Is my business structure simple (single operating entity)?** If multi-entity, have I modeled the complexity?

☐ **Do I have the cash flow to pay my salary consistently, even in slow months?**

☐ **Do I understand what a "reasonable salary" means for my industry/role?**

☐ **Am I prepared for additional compliance (941s, W-2s, board resolutions, meeting minutes)?**

☐ **Have I calculated my ACTUAL savings after subtracting $7,000-8,000 in annual costs?**

☐ **Is my current accountant experienced with S-Corp compliance and multi-entity structures?**

**If you answered "no" or "not sure" to more than 2 of these, you're not ready for S-Corp yet.** And that's okay.

Better to wait and do it right than rush in and regret it.

## The 20-Minute S-Corp Election (Once You're Ready)

Assuming you've answered "yes" to the readiness checklist, here's the actual process:

**If you already have an LLC:** File Form 2553. Takes 20 minutes. Done.  
**If you're a sole prop:** Form an LLC first, then file 2553. Takes a week. Still simple.

### Step 1: Form Your Entity (Skip if you're already an LLC)

**What:** File LLC formation with your state  
**Cost:** $100-$500  
**Time:** 1-2 weeks  

### Step 2: File Form 2553 with the IRS

**Critical deadline:** March 15th for current-year election.  
**Pro tip:** File in January/February. The IRS loses forms filed close to deadlines.

**→ [Want us to file it for you? Click here.](/contact)**

---

### Missed the March 15th Deadline? You're Not Out of Options

**The IRS offers late S-Corp election relief** if you miss the deadline.

**How it works:**
- File Form 2553 with a "reasonable cause" statement attached
- Explain why you missed the deadline (e.g., relied on tax professional who missed it, didn't know about deadline, etc.)
- IRS grants relief automatically if you meet certain conditions

**Conditions for automatic relief:**
1. You file within **3 years and 75 days** of the desired effective date
2. You and all shareholders report income consistent with S-Corp status
3. You have reasonable cause for missing the deadline

**Example:** You want S-Corp status for 2026 but missed March 15, 2026. You can still file late in 2026, 2027, or even early 2029 and request retroactive S-Corp treatment back to January 1, 2026.

**The catch:** 
- You must have been *operating* as an S-Corp (paying yourself salary, filing as if you were an S-Corp) even if you didn't officially elect
- Can't just decide retroactively "I wish I had been an S-Corp"
- Requires showing you intended to be an S-Corp and just missed the paperwork deadline

**Practical advice:**
- If you miss March 15th, don't panic
- File Form 2553 as soon as you realize the mistake
- Include a reasonable cause statement
- Start operating as an S-Corp immediately (set up payroll, pay yourself salary)
- Work with an EA who has experience with late elections

**We help clients with late elections regularly.** It's fixable. Just don't wait years—file within 12 months for best results.

**Missed the deadline?** [Contact us](/contact) and we'll help you file late election relief.

---

### Step 3: Set Up Payroll

You're now an employee. You need:
- Payroll service (Gusto, ADP, **QuickBooks Payroll**)
- State unemployment insurance registration
- Workers' comp (if required in Florida)

Need help with [payroll setup](/services)? We handle everything.

### Step 4: Update Your Accounting

Separate tracking for:
- Owner salary (W-2 wages)
- Distributions (from retained earnings)
- Shareholder loans (if applicable)
- Basis tracking (critical for distributions)

Your EA can set this up. We include this in our [S-Corp setup package](/contact).

### Step 5: File Quarterly Payroll Taxes

Form 941 is due quarterly. Payroll services handle this automatically.

**Don't skip this.** Missing 941s triggers instant IRS penalties.

## S-Corp vs. C-Corp vs. LLC: What's the Difference?

Quick comparison:

| | S-Corp | C-Corp | LLC (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tax treatment** | Pass-through (profit taxed once) | Double taxation (corporate + personal) | Pass-through |
| **SE tax savings** | Yes (on distributions) | N/A | No |
| **Shareholders** | Max 100, US citizens only | Unlimited | N/A (members) |
| **Best for** | Profitable service businesses, single entity | Raising VC, going public | Simple structure, flexibility |

**Bottom line:** Unless you're raising venture capital or planning to go public, S-Corp is better than C-Corp for most small business owners. But it's more complex than staying an LLC.

Read our complete guide: **Choosing the Right Business Entity**

---

## What About LLCs Taxed as Partnerships?

If you have multiple owners, the math gets more complex but S-Corp can still make sense—if total profit is high enough.

**Key differences:**
- Multiple W-2s (one per active owner)
- Distributions split by ownership %
- Even more administrative complexity

**When it makes sense:**
- Combined net profit over $200K
- All owners actively involved
- Clear roles and salary allocations
- Strong partnership agreement

We help multi-owner practices manage S-Corp structures. It requires clean books and excellent communication between partners.

---

## Next Steps: Should You Make the Switch?

### Do This Today:

**1. Calculate your actual net profit**  
Look at your last full-year tax return. What was your Schedule C net profit (or LLC K-1 income)?

**2. Run the real math**  
- Multiply distributions by 15.3% = gross savings
- Subtract $7,000-8,000 = net savings
- Is net savings worth the complexity?

**3. Answer the readiness checklist**  
If you answered "no" to more than 2 questions, you're not ready yet.

**4. Talk to an EA experienced with multi-entity structures**  
If they haven't brought up S-Corp *and explained when it doesn't make sense*, find someone who will.

## FAQ: S-Corp Election

### What is S-Corp election?

S-Corp election (Form 2553) allows your LLC or corporation to be taxed as an S-Corporation. You split income between salary (subject to payroll taxes) and distributions (not subject to SE tax). Only saves SE tax—income tax stays the same.

### When should I elect S-Corp status?

Elect S-Corp when your net profit consistently exceeds $100K per year AND you pass the readiness checklist. File Form 2553 by March 15th for current-year election. Below $100K, costs usually outweigh savings.

### How much does S-Corp election actually cost?

Realistic annual costs are $7,000-$8,000 (payroll, S-Corp return, bookkeeping, EA support). Setup is $500-$1,500. Lower advertised costs don't include professional guidance—which you'll want when the IRS comes knocking.

### What is a reasonable salary for S-Corp?

Reasonable salary matches what you'd pay someone to do your job. Typical ranges: $60K-$80K for $120K-$150K profit, $80K-$120K for $200K+ profit. Must be documented and defensible in an audit.

### Can I elect S-Corp with multiple LLCs?

Yes, but it's complicated. Each entity needs separate S-Corp election, payroll, and reasonable salary analysis. Costs multiply. Often NOT worth it unless one entity has $200K+ profit. Requires custom analysis.

### What's the deadline to elect S-Corp for 2026?

March 15, 2026 for calendar-year businesses. File in January-February to avoid processing delays. **Missed it? Late election relief is available**—you can file retroactively within 3 years and 75 days with reasonable cause. See "Missed the Deadline?" section above.

### Can I file S-Corp election after the March 15th deadline?

Yes! The IRS offers late election relief if you have reasonable cause. File Form 2553 with a statement explaining why you missed the deadline. You can file up to 3 years and 75 days after the desired effective date. Requires showing you operated as an S-Corp (paid salary, reported as S-Corp) even though paperwork was late. Work with an EA experienced in late elections—it's fixable.

### Does S-Corp make sense if I have variable income?

Usually no. If you set salary at $80K expecting $150K profit, but only make $90K, you're stuck paying payroll taxes on $80K salary from $90K profit. S-Corp works best with predictable profit.

---

## Final Thoughts

S-Corp election is a powerful tool for the right business at the right profit level. It's not a magic bullet. It's not right for everyone. And it's definitely not something to rush into because "successful businesses are S-Corps."

**If your net profit is consistently $150K+, you have a simple entity structure, and you're willing to handle the compliance:** S-Corp will likely save you $5K-$15K per year after costs.

**If your profit is under $100K, you have multiple entities, or you're not sure why you're doing it:** The juice probably isn't worth the squeeze.
