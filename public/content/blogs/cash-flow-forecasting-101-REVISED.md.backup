# Cash Flow Forecasting 101

"We're profitable on paper, but we can't make payroll."

Working with South Florida business owners through our fractional CFO services, I hear this more often than you'd think. Profitable businesses with serious cash problems.

The issue isn't revenue. It's not even profit. It's **cash flow**—and specifically, the inability to predict it.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **You can be profitable and still go out of business.**

Profit is accounting. Cash is survival. And if you can't forecast cash, you're flying blind.

The good news? **Cash flow forecasting** isn't complicated—it's just discipline. And I'm about to show you exactly how to do it, step by step, starting with why most business owners get this wrong.

---

## Why Cash Flow Forecasting Matters

**Scenario:** You land a $100K contract in January. Great! You invoice the client. They pay in 60 days (March). But you have to pay your team, rent, and suppliers in February.

**Profit says:** You made $100K!  
**Cash flow says:** You're $30K short in February.

**The result:** You're scrambling for a line of credit or delaying payments—both of which cost you money and stress.

**With cash flow forecasting:**
- You see the February shortfall in December
- You negotiate a deposit or faster payment terms
- Or you line up short-term financing before you need it
- Crisis avoided

---

## The Difference Between Profit and Cash Flow

**Profit** = Revenue - Expenses (accounting)  
**Cash Flow** = Cash In - Cash Out (reality)

### Why They're Different:

**1. Timing**  
You recognize revenue when you earn it, not when you're paid. Cash flow tracks actual money movement.

**2. Non-cash expenses**  
Depreciation, amortization—they reduce profit but don't touch cash.

**3. Cash expenses that aren't on the P&L**  
Loan principal payments, owner draws, equipment purchases—they drain cash but don't show as expenses.

**4. Accounts Receivable & Payable**  
You might have $50K in AR (which counts as revenue) but $0 in the bank. Learn more about [managing accounts receivable effectively](#).

**Example:**

| Month | Profit | Cash Flow |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| January | +$15K | -$8K (paid last month's bills, waiting on AR) |
| February | +$12K | +$22K (collected January AR) |
| March | +$18K | -$5K (bought equipment) |

**See the problem?** January was profitable but you lost cash. March was very profitable but you still lost cash.

Without forecasting, you'd be surprised every month.

## The 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast

The most practical tool for small businesses is a **13-week rolling cash flow forecast**.

**Why 13 weeks?**
- Long enough to see trends and upcoming issues
- Short enough to be reasonably accurate
- Matches a business quarter (roughly)

**Updated weekly** so you always have 13 weeks of visibility.

---

## How to Build Your Cash Flow Forecast (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Start with Cash on Hand

**Beginning Cash Balance**  
Check your bank account. That's your starting point.

**Example:** $32,000 in the bank today.

### Step 2: Project Cash IN (Receipts)

**Sources of cash:**
- Customer payments (accounts receivable collections)
- New sales (cash sales)
- Loan proceeds
- Owner contributions
- Tax refunds
- Other income

**How to estimate:**
- **Historical AR aging:** If you typically collect 50% of invoices in 30 days and 50% in 60 days, use that pattern.
- **Contracted/signed deals:** Count these with realistic payment timing.
- **Pipeline:** Be conservative. Only include high-confidence deals.

**Example:**
| Week | Customer Payments | New Cash Sales | Total Cash IN |
|------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Week 1 | $8,500 | $2,000 | $10,500 |
| Week 2 | $12,000 | $1,500 | $13,500 |
| Week 3 | $6,000 | $2,500 | $8,500 |

### Step 3: Project Cash OUT (Payments)

**Uses of cash:**
- Payroll (employees, owners)
- Rent/facilities
- Vendor/supplier payments
- Loan payments
- Credit card payments
- Taxes (income, payroll, sales)
- Insurance
- Utilities
- Equipment purchases
- Other expenses

**How to estimate:**
- **Fixed costs:** You know exactly what these are (rent, insurance, loan payments).
- **Variable costs:** Use historical averages or percentages of revenue.
- **Payroll:** You know your payroll schedule and amounts.
- **Vendors:** Check your AP aging and payment terms.

**Example:**
| Week | Payroll | Rent | Vendors | Loan | Other | Total Cash OUT |
|------|---------|------|---------|------|-------|----------------|
| Week 1 | $15,000 | $0 | $3,200 | $0 | $800 | $19,000 |
| Week 2 | $0 | $4,500 | $6,500 | $2,100 | $1,200 | $14,300 |
| Week 3 | $15,000 | $0 | $4,000 | $0 | $600 | $19,600 |

### Step 4: Calculate Net Cash Flow

**Net Cash Flow = Cash IN - Cash OUT**

| Week | Cash IN | Cash OUT | Net Cash Flow |
|------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Week 1 | $10,500 | $19,000 | -$8,500 |
| Week 2 | $13,500 | $14,300 | -$800 |
| Week 3 | $8,500 | $19,600 | -$11,100 |

### Step 5: Project Ending Cash Balance

**Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Net Cash Flow**

| Week | Beginning Cash | Net Cash Flow | Ending Cash |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Week 1 | $32,000 | -$8,500 | $23,500 |
| Week 2 | $23,500 | -$800 | $22,700 |
| Week 3 | $22,700 | -$11,100 | $11,600 |

### Step 6: Identify Cash Shortfalls

**Look for:**
- Weeks where ending cash goes below your minimum buffer (e.g., $10K)
- Negative ending cash (disaster zone)
- Downward trends

**In the example above:** Week 3 brings you down to $11,600. If your minimum is $10K, you're cutting it close.

## What to Do When You See a Cash Shortfall

### Option 1: Accelerate Cash IN

**Actions:**
- Follow up on overdue invoices
- Offer early payment discounts (2% off if paid in 10 days)
- Require deposits on new work
- Tighten payment terms (Net 30 → Net 15)
- Take a short-term loan or line of credit

**Example:** In Week 2, you call the client with the $12K outstanding invoice and ask for payment by Friday instead of waiting another week. Cash problem solved.

### Option 2: Delay Cash OUT

**Actions:**
- Negotiate extended payment terms with vendors
- Delay non-essential purchases
- Reduce owner draws temporarily
- Defer equipment purchases
- Switch to bi-weekly payroll (if legal in your state)

**Caution:** Don't delay payroll taxes or loan payments. The IRS and banks don't mess around.

### Option 3: Cut Costs

**Actions:**
- Eliminate discretionary spending
- Renegotiate contracts (insurance, software, etc.)
- Reduce hours for part-time staff
- Pause hiring

**Not ideal long-term, but sometimes necessary to survive a short-term crunch.**

### Option 4: Inject Capital

**Actions:**
- Owner contribution (put your own money in)
- Small business loan or SBA loan
- Line of credit
- Sell unnecessary assets

**Use this sparingly.** If you're constantly injecting cash, you have a business model problem, not a cash flow problem.

## Monthly Cash Flow Forecasting for Small Business

13-week forecasts are for short-term survival. **Monthly forecasts** are for strategy.

**Build a 12-month rolling forecast:**

Same concept, but:
- Monthly instead of weekly
- Longer visibility
- Useful for planning hiring, expansion, equipment purchases

**Review quarterly:**
- Compare actual vs. forecast
- Adjust assumptions
- Identify seasonal patterns

**Example:** If you always have a cash crunch in Q1 (post-holiday slump), you can plan for it in Q4 by building reserves or securing a line of credit.

## Common Cash Flow Forecasting Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Being Too Optimistic

**The trap:** "That client will definitely pay this week!"

**Reality:** They won't. And now you can't make payroll.

**Fix:** Use conservative assumptions. Add 1-2 weeks to expected payment dates.

### Mistake #2: Forgetting One-Time Expenses

**The trap:** Your forecast looks great, then you remember you owe $8K in quarterly taxes.

**Reality:** Surprise cash crunch.

**Fix:** Keep a list of annual/quarterly expenses and add them to the right weeks/months. Check out our guide on [quarterly tax planning](#).

### Mistake #3: Not Updating the Forecast

**The trap:** You build a forecast in January and never look at it again.

**Reality:** It's useless by March.

**Fix:** Update weekly (13-week) or monthly (12-month). Make it a habit.

### Mistake #4: Confusing Profit with Cash

**The trap:** "We're profitable, so we have cash."

**Reality:** Not necessarily. See the profit vs. cash flow section above.

**Fix:** Track BOTH. Profit is long-term health. Cash is short-term survival.

### Mistake #5: No Cash Buffer

**The trap:** Running your account down to $500 and hoping for the best.

**Reality:** One late payment and you're bouncing checks.

**Fix:** Set a minimum cash balance (e.g., $10K or 1 month of operating expenses) and never go below it.

## Cash Flow Forecasting Case Study: Restaurant Group

**Client:** 2-location restaurant, $2.4M annual revenue

**Problem:** Constantly short on cash despite profitability. Relied on credit cards to cover gaps.

**Root cause:** 
- Inventory purchases happened in bulk (big cash outflows)
- Revenue was consistent but slower during summer months
- No forecast = no visibility

**Solution:**
- Built 13-week cash flow forecast
- Identified June-July cash crunch 3 months early
- Negotiated net-30 terms with main suppliers (was paying on delivery)
- Built $25K cash reserve during busy season (March-May)
- Reduced inventory orders in slow months

**Result:** 
- Cash buffer went from $3K (terrifying) to $25K (comfortable)
- No more credit card reliance
- Owner could finally sleep at night

**Cost of solution:** 2 hours/month updating forecast + our [CFO advisory](#) fee

**Value:** Avoided $8K in credit card interest, eliminated stress, enabled confident decision-making

## How to Actually Do This Every Week

**Monday Morning Routine (15 minutes):**

1. **Check actual cash** (bank balance)
2. **Update last week** (what actually happened vs. forecast?)
3. **Adjust this week** (anything change? new invoices? unexpected expenses?)
4. **Roll forward** (delete last week, add a new week at the end)
5. **Flag issues** (any cash shortfalls in the next 13 weeks?)
6. **Take action** (if shortfall, make calls/adjustments)

**Make it a habit.** Same time every week. Non-negotiable.

**Delegate it:** Your bookkeeper or accountant can do the updating. You just review and make decisions. Need [bookkeeping support](#)? We offer real-time bookkeeping services.

## Seasonal Business? You REALLY Need This

If your revenue is seasonal (landscaping, pool services, tourism, etc.), cash flow forecasting isn't optional—it's survival.

**Strategy:**
- **Build reserves during peak season** (sock away 20-30% of peak revenue)
- **Line up financing before you need it** (get a line of credit approved in peak season, use in off-season)
- **Adjust expenses seasonally** (reduce hours, defer purchases during slow months)
- **Forecast a full year** so you see the cycle and can plan

## Still Reading? You're Not Alone.

Most business owners get to this point and think one of two things:

1. **"This makes sense, but I know I won't actually do it every week."**
2. **"I'll do this for a month, then life gets busy and it falls apart."**

If that's you, we get it. That's exactly why our [fractional CFO service](#) exists.

## FAQ: Cash Flow Forecasting

### What is cash flow forecasting?

Cash flow forecasting is the process of estimating when cash will come into and go out of your business over a specific period. It helps you predict shortfalls before they happen so you can take action.

### How often should I update my cash flow forecast?

Update your 13-week forecast weekly (takes 15 minutes). Update your 12-month forecast monthly. Make it a Monday morning routine.

### What's the difference between profit and cash flow?

Profit is an accounting measure (revenue minus expenses). Cash flow is actual money movement. You can be profitable but run out of cash due to timing, AR delays, or capital purchases.
