- Year-end tax articles → Publish Oct-Nov
- Q1 planning articles → Publish Dec-Jan
- Tax season articles → Publish Jan-Mar
- Mid-year reviews → Publish May-Jun

**Do NOT publish seasonal content after the window passes.** Schedule for next year instead.

### Evergreen Content
- Can publish anytime
- Examples: "S-Corp vs LLC," "Cash Flow Forecasting 101," "How to Read a P&L"
- Refresh annually with updated examples/stats

- ❌ Wrong credentials (CPA instead of EA)
- ❌ Outdated/impossible dates
- ❌ Zero internal links
- ❌ No CTA or weak CTA
- ❌ Seasonal content published after deadline
- ❌ Gerrit hasn't approved final version

**Green Lights - Safe to Publish:**
- ✅ All required agents grade A- or higher (3-5 depending on content type)
- ✅ EA credential correct
- ✅ Topical and timely
- ✅ 5+ internal links added
- ✅ Strong hook and CTAs
- ✅ Gerrit has signed off

- ✅ Financial accuracy verified (if financial content) - formulas and operational feasibility confirmed

---

## CONTENT CALENDAR INTEGRATION

### Scheduling Rules
1. **Check relevance:** Is this timely or evergreen?
2. **Check calendar:** What else is publishing that week?
3. **Space out topics:** Don't publish 3 tax articles in a row
4. **Plan ahead:** Seasonal content scheduled 2-3 months in advance

### Monthly Content Mix
- **2 blog articles** (1 seasonal, 1 evergreen)
- **8 LinkedIn posts** (2/week)
- **1 email newsletter** (mid-month)
- **4 Twitter/X threads** (1/week)
