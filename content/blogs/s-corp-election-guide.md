# S-Corp Election: Is It Right for Your Business?

If you're a profitable small business owner still operating as a sole proprietor or standard LLC, you're probably paying too much in taxes.

Not because you're doing anything wrong. Not because your CPA is incompetent. Simply because your entity structure isn't optimized for your income level.

Let me be direct: **If your net profit is over $60,000 per year, S-Corp election will likely save you $10,000-$30,000 annually in self-employment taxes.**

That's not a typo. And it's not a loophole that's going away. It's how the tax code is designed to work.

Here's everything you need to know to make an informed decision.

---

## What Is an S-Corp (and What It Isn't)

First, let's clear up confusion:

**An S-Corp is not a business entity.** It's a **tax election**. You're still an LLC or corporation. You're just choosing to be taxed differently.

**Without S-Corp election:**
- Single-member LLC = Taxed as sole proprietor
- Multi-member LLC = Taxed as partnership
- Corporation = Taxed as C-Corp (double taxation)

**With S-Corp election:**
- Your LLC or corporation is taxed as an S-Corporation
- You become an employee of your own business
- You split your income between salary and distributions
- **Distributions are not subject to self-employment tax**

That last bullet is where the magic happens.

## The Tax Math: Why S-Corps Save Money

Let's use real numbers.

### Scenario: LLC Taxed as Sole Proprietor

**Net profit:** $120,000  
**Self-employment tax (15.3%):** $18,130  
**Federal income tax (24% bracket):** ~$17,000  
**Total taxes:** ~$35,130

### Scenario: Same Business, S-Corp Election

**Reasonable salary:** $70,000  
**Distributions:** $50,000

**Payroll taxes on salary (15.3%):** $10,710  
**Federal income tax:** ~$17,000 (same)  
**Payroll taxes on distributions:** $0  
**Total taxes:** ~$27,710

**Savings: $7,420/year**

And that's conservative. Higher profits = higher savings.

## When Does S-Corp Make Sense?

### ✅ You're a Good Candidate If:

**1. Your net profit is consistently over $60K/year**  
Below $60K, the administrative costs and complexity often outweigh the tax savings.

**2. You're in a service-based business**  
Consultants, healthcare providers, attorneys, accountants, designers, coaches—anyone selling expertise.

**3. You're already profitable and expect to stay that way**  
S-Corp doesn't make sense for startups burning cash or businesses with inconsistent income.

**4. You're willing to run payroll**  
You'll need to pay yourself via W-2, which means payroll setup, quarterly 941s, and year-end W-2s.

**5. You want to reinvest profits or take distributions flexibly**  
S-Corps give you more control over how and when you take money out.

### ❌ S-Corp Might Not Be Right If:

**1. Your net profit is under $40K**  
The juice isn't worth the squeeze. Administrative costs eat up the savings.

**2. You plan to raise venture capital**  
VCs and many investors prefer C-Corps. S-Corps have shareholder restrictions.

**3. You want to retain earnings long-term**  
S-Corps are pass-through entities—you're taxed on profit whether you take it out or not.

**4. You have non-resident alien shareholders**  
S-Corps can only have U.S. citizens/residents as shareholders.

**5. You're not willing to handle additional compliance**  
S-Corps require payroll, reasonable salary justification, and proper documentation.

## The "Reasonable Salary" Question

Here's where business owners get nervous:

**The IRS requires you to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" before taking distributions.**

Too low of a salary = audit risk.  
Too high = you're not maximizing savings.

So what's "reasonable"?

**The IRS looks at:**
- What similar positions earn in your industry
- Your role and responsibilities in the business
- Time spent working
- Business profitability

**General guidelines:**
- **$50K-$70K** for most service-based businesses in the $100K-$150K profit range
- **$70K-$100K** if you're the primary revenue generator and profit is $200K+
- **$40K-$60K** if you have other team members doing the work and you're more of an owner/manager

**The test:** Could you hire someone to do your job for this salary? If yes, it's probably reasonable.

We've helped dozens of clients navigate IRS audits on reasonable compensation. With proper documentation, it's rarely an issue.

## The Real Costs of S-Corp Status

Let's be transparent about what this actually costs:

### Setup Costs (One-Time)

**DIY Route:**
- Form 2553 (S-Corp election): Free
- State filings (varies): $0-$500

**With Professional Help:**
- CPA or attorney setup: $500-$1,500
- Includes election filing, EIN, state registrations

### Ongoing Annual Costs

**Payroll:**
- Payroll service (Gusto, ADP, etc.): $500-$1,200/year
- Quarterly 941 filings: Included or $100-$200 if outsourced

**Tax Preparation:**
- S-Corp tax return (Form 1120-S): Add $800-$2,000 to your existing tax prep fee
- More complex than Schedule C, less complex than C-Corp

**Accounting:**
- Proper bookkeeping (separating salary vs. distributions): +$200-$500/year if outsourced
- Most businesses should already be doing this

**Total annual cost estimate: $1,500-$3,500**

**Break-even point:** You need to save at least $3,500/year in taxes for S-Corp to make sense.

At $60K net profit, you're saving ~$4,500. Worth it.  
At $100K net profit, you're saving ~$10,000. Definitely worth it.  
At $200K+ net profit, you're saving $15K-$30K. No-brainer.

## How to Make the S-Corp Election

### Step 1: Form Your Entity (If You Haven't Already)

You need to be an LLC or corporation first. If you're currently a sole proprietor, form an LLC in your state.

**Cost:** $100-$500 depending on state  
**Time:** 1-2 weeks

### Step 2: File Form 2553 with the IRS

This is the S-Corp election form. It's free and can be filed online.

**Critical deadlines:**
- **For current year:** Must file by March 15th
- **For next year:** Can file anytime, but March 15th is safest
- **New entity:** Within 2 months and 15 days of formation (or start of tax year)

**Pro tip:** File in January or February to avoid issues. The IRS has been known to "lose" forms filed close to the deadline.

### Step 3: Set Up Payroll

You're now an employee. You need:
- Payroll service (Gusto, ADP, QuickBooks Payroll)
- State unemployment insurance registration
- Workers' comp (if required in your state)

**How often to pay yourself:**
- Monthly is most common for small S-Corps
- Some do quarterly if profit is variable
- Must be consistent and documented

### Step 4: Update Your Accounting

Separate accounts for:
- Owner salary (W-2 wages)
- Distributions (from retained earnings)
- Shareholder loans (if applicable)

Your bookkeeper or CPA can help set this up.

### Step 5: File Quarterly Payroll Taxes

Form 941 is due quarterly. Most payroll services handle this automatically.

**Don't skip this.** Missing 941s triggers IRS penalties fast.

## Common S-Corp Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: No Salary, Only Distributions

**The trap:** "I'll just take distributions and avoid payroll taxes entirely!"

**Reality:** The IRS will reclassify your distributions as salary and hit you with penalties, back taxes, and interest.

**Fix:** Pay yourself a reasonable salary BEFORE taking distributions.

### Mistake #2: Salary Too Low

**The trap:** "$30K salary, $120K distributions—I'm gaming the system!"

**Reality:** Audit risk. The IRS isn't stupid.

**Fix:** Use industry benchmarks. Document your reasoning. Err on the side of caution.

### Mistake #3: Not Running Payroll

**The trap:** "I'll just call it a salary but not actually do payroll."

**Reality:** That's not a salary. That's a distribution. No tax savings.

**Fix:** Actual W-2. Actual payroll taxes. Actual 941s.

### Mistake #4: Missing the Election Deadline

**The trap:** "I'll elect S-Corp in December for this year."

**Reality:** Too late. Deadline was March 15th.

**Fix:** File Form 2553 in January or February. Set a reminder.

### Mistake #5: Not Keeping Good Records

**The trap:** "I don't need to document anything."

**Reality:** In an audit, the burden of proof is on YOU.

**Fix:** Keep payroll records, board resolutions, shareholder meeting minutes (even if it's just you).

## Real Client Example: The Dentist Who Saved $24K

**Client:** Solo dentist, associate dentist practice  
**Structure before:** Single-member LLC (taxed as sole prop)  
**Net profit:** $280,000/year

**Taxes before S-Corp:**
- Self-employment tax: $37,000  
- Income tax: ~$52,000  
- **Total: $89,000**

**After S-Corp election:**
- Reasonable salary: $150,000  
- Self-employment tax on salary: $22,950  
- Distributions: $130,000 (no SE tax)  
- Income tax: ~$52,000 (same)  
- **Total: $74,950**

**Annual savings: $24,050**

**S-Corp costs: $2,500/year**

**Net benefit: $21,550/year**

Over 10 years? **$215,000** in tax savings. That's a lake house. That's two kids' college funds. That's early retirement.

## What About LLCs Taxed as Partnerships?

If you have multiple owners, the math gets more complex but S-Corp often still makes sense.

**Key differences:**
- Multiple W-2s (one per owner/active participant)
- Distributions split according to ownership %
- More administrative complexity

**When it makes sense:**
- Combined net profit over $150K
- Owners actively involved in the business
- Clear ownership split and roles

We help several multi-owner practices manage S-Corp structures. It's doable, but you need clean books and good communication between partners.

---

## S-Corp vs. C-Corp: What's the Difference?

Quick comparison for those considering C-Corp:

| | S-Corp | C-Corp |
|---|---|---|
| **Tax treatment** | Pass-through (profit taxed once) | Double taxation (corporate + personal) |
| **Shareholders** | Max 100, must be US citizens | Unlimited, can be foreign |
| **Stock classes** | One class only | Multiple classes allowed |
| **Best for** | Small business owners, service businesses | Startups raising VC, large corporations |
| **Dividend tax** | No (distributions taxed at personal rate) | Yes (qualified dividends at 15-20%) |

**Bottom line:** Unless you're raising venture capital or planning to go public, S-Corp is almost always better for small business owners.

---

## Next Steps: Should You Make the Switch?

### Do This Today:

**1. Calculate your net profit**  
Look at your last full-year tax return. What was your Schedule C net profit (or LLC K-1 income)?

**2. Estimate your tax savings**  
- Multiply net profit by 15.3%
- Subtract reasonable salary × 15.3%
- Remaining amount = estimated savings

**3. Compare to costs**  
If savings > $5,000/year, it's probably worth it.

**4. Talk to your CPA**  
If they haven't brought up S-Corp and you're profitable, ask why not.

## The Deadline: Don't Wait

If you want S-Corp status for 2026, **you must file Form 2553 by March 15th, 2026.**

If you miss it, you're stuck with your current structure for another year—and another year of overpaying taxes.

## Final Thoughts

S-Corp election isn't right for everyone. But if you're a profitable small business owner, it's worth 30 minutes of analysis to find out if you could save $10K-$30K per year.
