# Cash Flow Forecasting 101

"We're profitable on paper, but we can't make payroll."

I hear this more often than you'd think. Profitable businesses with serious cash problems.

The issue isn't revenue. It's not even profit. It's **cash flow**—and specifically, the inability to predict it.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **You can be profitable and still go out of business.**

Profit is accounting. Cash is survival. And if you can't forecast cash, you're flying blind.

Let me show you exactly how to fix this.

---

## Why Cash Flow Forecasting Matters

**Scenario:** You land a $100K contract in January. Great! You invoice the client. They pay in 60 days (March). But you have to pay your team, rent, and suppliers in February.

**Profit says:** You made $100K!  
**Cash flow says:** You're $30K short in February.

**The result:** You're scrambling for a line of credit or delaying payments—both of which cost you money and stress.

**With cash flow forecasting:**
- You see the February shortfall in December
- You negotiate a deposit or faster payment terms
- Or you line up short-term financing before you need it
- Crisis avoided

## The Difference Between Profit and Cash Flow

**Profit** = Revenue - Expenses (accounting)  
**Cash Flow** = Cash In - Cash Out (reality)

### Why They're Different:

**1. Timing**  
You recognize revenue when you earn it, not when you're paid. Cash flow tracks actual money movement.

**2. Non-cash expenses**  
Depreciation, amortization—they reduce profit but don't touch cash.

**3. Cash expenses that aren't on the P&L**  
Loan principal payments, owner draws, equipment purchases—they drain cash but don't show as expenses.

**4. Accounts Receivable & Payable**  
You might have $50K in AR (which counts as revenue) but $0 in the bank.

**Example:**

| Month | Profit | Cash Flow |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| January | +$15K | -$8K (paid last month's bills, waiting on AR) |
| February | +$12K | +$22K (collected January AR) |
| March | +$18K | -$5K (bought equipment) |

**See the problem?** January was profitable but you lost cash. March was very profitable but you still lost cash.

Without forecasting, you'd be surprised every month.

## The 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast

The most practical tool for small businesses is a **13-week rolling cash flow forecast**.

**Why 13 weeks?**
- Long enough to see trends and upcoming issues
- Short enough to be reasonably accurate
- Matches a business quarter (roughly)

**Updated weekly** so you always have 13 weeks of visibility.

## How to Build Your Cash Flow Forecast (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Start with Cash on Hand

**Beginning Cash Balance**  
Check your bank account. That's your starting point.

**Example:** $32,000 in the bank today.

### Step 2: Project Cash IN (Receipts)

**Sources of cash:**
- Customer payments (accounts receivable collections)
- New sales (cash sales)
- Loan proceeds
- Owner contributions
- Tax refunds
- Other income

**How to estimate:**
- **Historical AR aging:** If you typically collect 50% of invoices in 30 days and 50% in 60 days, use that pattern.
- **Contracted/signed deals:** Count these with realistic payment timing.
- **Pipeline:** Be conservative. Only include high-confidence deals.

**Example:**
| Week | Customer Payments | New Cash Sales | Total Cash IN |
|------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Week 1 | $8,500 | $2,000 | $10,500 |
| Week 2 | $12,000 | $1,500 | $13,500 |
| Week 3 | $6,000 | $2,500 | $8,500 |

### Step 3: Project Cash OUT (Payments)

**Uses of cash:**
- Payroll (employees, owners)
- Rent/facilities
- Vendor/supplier payments
- Loan payments
- Credit card payments
- Taxes (income, payroll, sales)
- Insurance
- Utilities
- Equipment purchases
- Other expenses

**How to estimate:**
- **Fixed costs:** You know exactly what these are (rent, insurance, loan payments).
- **Variable costs:** Use historical averages or percentages of revenue.
- **Payroll:** You know your payroll schedule and amounts.
- **Vendors:** Check your AP aging and payment terms.

**Example:**
| Week | Payroll | Rent | Vendors | Loan | Other | Total Cash OUT |
|------|---------|------|---------|------|-------|----------------|
| Week 1 | $15,000 | $0 | $3,200 | $0 | $800 | $19,000 |
| Week 2 | $0 | $4,500 | $6,500 | $2,100 | $1,200 | $14,300 |
| Week 3 | $15,000 | $0 | $4,000 | $0 | $600 | $19,600 |

### Step 4: Calculate Net Cash Flow

**Net Cash Flow = Cash IN - Cash OUT**

| Week | Cash IN | Cash OUT | Net Cash Flow |
|------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Week 1 | $10,500 | $19,000 | -$8,500 |
| Week 2 | $13,500 | $14,300 | -$800 |
| Week 3 | $8,500 | $19,600 | -$11,100 |

### Step 5: Project Ending Cash Balance

**Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Net Cash Flow**

| Week | Beginning Cash | Net Cash Flow | Ending Cash |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Week 1 | $32,000 | -$8,500 | $23,500 |
| Week 2 | $23,500 | -$800 | $22,700 |
| Week 3 | $22,700 | -$11,100 | $11,600 |

### Step 6: Identify Cash Shortfalls

**Look for:**
- Weeks where ending cash goes below your minimum buffer (e.g., $10K)
- Negative ending cash (disaster zone)
- Downward trends

**In the example above:** Week 3 brings you down to $11,600. If your minimum is $10K, you're cutting it close.

## What to Do When You See a Cash Shortfall

### Option 1: Accelerate Cash IN

**Actions:**
- Follow up on overdue invoices
- Offer early payment discounts (2% off if paid in 10 days)
- Require deposits on new work
- Tighten payment terms (Net 30 → Net 15)
- Take a short-term loan or line of credit

**Example:** In Week 2, you call the client with the $12K outstanding invoice and ask for payment by Friday instead of waiting another week. Cash problem solved.

### Option 2: Delay Cash OUT

**Actions:**
- Negotiate extended payment terms with vendors
- Delay non-essential purchases
- Reduce owner draws temporarily
- Defer equipment purchases
- Switch to bi-weekly payroll (if legal in your state)

**Caution:** Don't delay payroll taxes or loan payments. The IRS and banks don't mess around.

### Option 3: Cut Costs

**Actions:**
- Eliminate discretionary spending
- Renegotiate contracts (insurance, software, etc.)
- Reduce hours for part-time staff
- Pause hiring

**Not ideal long-term, but sometimes necessary to survive a short-term crunch.**

### Option 4: Inject Capital

**Actions:**
- Owner contribution (put your own money in)
- Small business loan or SBA loan
- Line of credit
- Sell unnecessary assets

**Use this sparingly.** If you're constantly injecting cash, you have a business model problem, not a cash flow problem.

## Monthly Cash Flow Forecasting (The Big Picture)

13-week forecasts are for short-term survival. **Monthly forecasts** are for strategy.

**Build a 12-month rolling forecast:**

Same concept, but:
- Monthly instead of weekly
- Longer visibility
- Useful for planning hiring, expansion, equipment purchases

**Review quarterly:**
- Compare actual vs. forecast
- Adjust assumptions
- Identify seasonal patterns

**Example:** If you always have a cash crunch in Q1 (post-holiday slump), you can plan for it in Q4 by building reserves or securing a line of credit.

---

## Tools to Use

You don't need fancy software. A spreadsheet works fine.

### Option 1: Excel/Google Sheets (Free)

**Pros:** Flexible, customizable, works offline  
**Cons:** Manual, no automation, easy to mess up

**Best for:** Small businesses, simple cash flow

**Template:** We can provide a template if you work with us.

### Option 2: QuickBooks Cash Flow Planner (Included with QBO)

**Pros:** Pulls directly from your books, automatic AR/AP, decent forecasting  
**Cons:** Not super flexible, sometimes buggy

**Best for:** QBO users who want automation

### Option 3: Float, Pulse, Dryrun (Paid Tools)

**Pros:** Purpose-built for cash flow forecasting, scenario planning, beautiful dashboards  
**Cons:** Monthly fee ($50-$150/mo)

**Best for:** Larger businesses or those with complex cash flow

### Option 4: Work with Your CPA/CFO

**Pros:** Expert guidance, customized to your business, accountability  
**Cons:** Costs money (but ROI is usually positive)

**Best for:** Businesses that want strategic help, not just a tool

## Common Cash Flow Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Being Too Optimistic

**The trap:** "That client will definitely pay this week!"

**Reality:** They won't. And now you can't make payroll.

**Fix:** Use conservative assumptions. Add 1-2 weeks to expected payment dates.

### Mistake #2: Forgetting One-Time Expenses

**The trap:** Your forecast looks great, then you remember you owe $8K in quarterly taxes.

**Reality:** Surprise cash crunch.

**Fix:** Keep a list of annual/quarterly expenses and add them to the right weeks/months.

### Mistake #3: Not Updating the Forecast

**The trap:** You build a forecast in January and never look at it again.

**Reality:** It's useless by March.

**Fix:** Update weekly (13-week) or monthly (12-month). Make it a habit.

### Mistake #4: Confusing Profit with Cash

**The trap:** "We're profitable, so we have cash."

**Reality:** Not necessarily. See the beginning of this article.

**Fix:** Track BOTH. Profit is long-term health. Cash is short-term survival.

### Mistake #5: No Cash Buffer

**The trap:** Running your account down to $500 and hoping for the best.

**Reality:** One late payment and you're bouncing checks.

**Fix:** Set a minimum cash balance (e.g., $10K or 1 month of operating expenses) and never go below it.

## Real Client Example: Restaurant Group

**Client:** 2-location restaurant, $2.4M annual revenue

**Problem:** Constantly short on cash despite profitability. Relied on credit cards to cover gaps.

**Root cause:** 
- Inventory purchases happened in bulk (big cash outflows)
- Revenue was consistent but slower during summer months
- No forecast = no visibility

**Solution:**
- Built 13-week cash flow forecast
- Identified June-July cash crunch 3 months early
- Negotiated net-30 terms with main suppliers (was paying on delivery)
- Built $25K cash reserve during busy season (March-May)
- Reduced inventory orders in slow months

**Result:** 
- Cash buffer went from $3K (terrifying) to $25K (comfortable)
- No more credit card reliance
- Owner could finally sleep at night

**Cost of solution:** 2 hours/month updating forecast + our CFO advisory fee

**Value:** Avoided $8K in credit card interest, eliminated stress, enabled confident decision-making

## How to Actually Do This Every Week

**Monday Morning Routine (15 minutes):**

1. **Check actual cash** (bank balance)
2. **Update last week** (what actually happened vs. forecast?)
3. **Adjust this week** (anything change? new invoices? unexpected expenses?)
4. **Roll forward** (delete last week, add a new week at the end)
5. **Flag issues** (any cash shortfalls in the next 13 weeks?)
6. **Take action** (if shortfall, make calls/adjustments)

**Make it a habit.** Same time every week. Non-negotiable.

**Delegate it:** Your bookkeeper or accountant can do the updating. You just review and make decisions.

---

## Seasonal Business? You REALLY Need This

If your revenue is seasonal (landscaping, pool services, tourism, etc.), cash flow forecasting isn't optional—it's survival.

**Strategy:**
- **Build reserves during peak season** (sock away 20-30% of peak revenue)
- **Line up financing before you need it** (get a line of credit approved in peak season, use in off-season)
- **Adjust expenses seasonally** (reduce hours, defer purchases during slow months)
- **Forecast a full year** so you see the cycle and can plan
