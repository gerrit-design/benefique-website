# How a Multi-Location Radiology Practice Got Real-Time Financial Visibility

When you're operating three radiology facilities across different locations, financial visibility becomes exponentially harder. Each site has its own revenue streams, expense profiles, and operational nuances. But when you can't see profitability by location—and it takes three weeks to close the month—you're flying blind in an industry where margins matter.

This is the story of how one multi-location radiology practice transformed from delayed, fragmented financial reporting to **same-day visibility** with location-level P&Ls and automated dashboards.

## The Problem: Blind Growth

Our client (we'll call them "Premier Radiology") was a success story on paper. Three locations. Strong referral relationships. Growing patient volume. But behind the scenes, their financial operations were struggling to keep pace.

### The Pain Points

**Month-End Chaos**
- Closing the books took 2-3 weeks after month-end
- By the time reports arrived, the data was already outdated
- Decision-making was always reactive, never proactive

**No Location-Level Insight**
- Consolidated P&L only—couldn't see individual location performance
- Didn't know which sites were profitable and which were bleeding cash
- Expansion decisions were based on gut feel, not data

**Manual Processes Everywhere**
- Financial data lived in multiple systems (QBO, billing platform, spreadsheets)
- Weekly reports required hours of manual consolidation
- CFO spent more time assembling data than analyzing it

**Limited Visibility for Leadership**
- Executive team couldn't access financials without requesting reports
- No way to quickly check key metrics (cash position, collections, A/R aging)
- Board meetings required days of preparation

The breaking point? They were considering a fourth location but had no reliable way to model profitability or assess whether existing locations could support the expansion.

## The Solution: Real-Time CFO Dashboard + Automated Reporting

We designed a comprehensive financial operations overhaul focused on three pillars: **automation, visibility, and actionable insights**.

### 1. Custom CFO Dashboard

We built an interactive, web-based dashboard that displays:
- **Real-time cash position** (updated daily)
- **Location-level P&Ls** (compare side-by-side)
- **Collections tracking** (by location and payer)
- **A/R aging** (visual heat maps for quick identification of issues)
- **Key performance indicators** (revenue per location, overhead %, collection rate)
- **Trend analysis** (month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons)

The dashboard lives on a secure, password-protected URL. Leadership can access it 24/7 from any device. No more waiting for reports.

### 2. Location-Level Accounting Structure

We restructured their QuickBooks setup to enable true multi-location tracking:
- **Separate classes for each location** (cleanly segregated revenue and expenses)
- **Automated allocation rules** (corporate overhead distributed based on revenue)
- **Standardized chart of accounts** (consistent categorization across all sites)
- **Vendor tracking by location** (visibility into site-specific costs)

Result? For the first time, they could see exactly which locations were driving profitability—and which needed attention.

### 3. Automated Weekly Reporting

We eliminated manual consolidation with automated weekly reports delivered via email:
- **Cash flow snapshot** (cash in, cash out, net position)
- **Collections summary** (by location and insurance carrier)
- **A/R aging alerts** (automatic flagging of accounts >90 days)
- **Payroll vs. budget** (identify cost overruns early)

Reports are generated automatically every Monday morning. The CFO gets actionable insights without lifting a finger.

### 4. Daily Accounting Rhythm

We shifted from monthly chaos to **daily discipline**:
- **Bank feeds reconciled daily** (no more month-end surprises)
- **Transactions categorized in real-time** (by our team, following their custom rules)
- **Weekly check-ins** (15-minute syncs to review metrics and flag issues)

Month-end close became a **3-day process** instead of 3 weeks—because 90% of the work was already done.

## The Results: Speed, Clarity, and Confidence

### Before and After

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Month-End Close Time** | 2-3 weeks | 3 days |
| **Financial Statement Availability** | 21 days after month-end | Same day |
| **Location Profitability Visibility** | None | Real-time, by site |
| **CFO Time Spent on Data Assembly** | 15 hours/week | <2 hours/week |
| **Executive Dashboard Access** | Email-only, on request | 24/7, self-service |
| **Decision Speed** | Weeks (waiting for data) | Hours (data always available) |

### Business Impact

**Identified Underperforming Location**
Within two months of implementing location-level P&Ls, they discovered that one site was operating at a **12% lower margin** than the other two. Root cause? Higher staffing costs and lower utilization rates. They adjusted staffing levels and improved scheduling efficiency, bringing margins back in line.

**Improved Collections Process**
The automated A/R aging dashboard revealed patterns in delayed insurance payments. They adjusted their follow-up cadence with specific carriers and **reduced days in A/R from 48 to 38 days**—a significant cash flow improvement.

**Confident Expansion Decision**
When the fourth location opportunity arose, they had the financial data to model it properly. They knew their per-location overhead costs, average revenue ramp timelines, and breakeven thresholds. The expansion moved forward with **data-backed confidence** instead of guesswork.

**CFO Focused on Strategy**
The CFO went from spending 60% of her time on data assembly to spending 80% on strategic analysis and decision support. She now has time to:
- Model acquisition scenarios
- Optimize payer mix
- Negotiate better terms with vendors
- Plan capital investments

**Board Meetings Transformed**
Board meetings shifted from "reviewing last month's numbers" to "strategic planning based on current data." Leadership could pull up the dashboard during meetings and answer questions in real-time.

## Key Lessons: What Made This Work

### 1. Automation First
Manual processes don't scale. Every hour spent copying and pasting data is an hour not spent on analysis. Invest in automation early.

### 2. Structure Matters
QuickBooks (or any accounting system) is only as good as its setup. Clean chart of accounts, consistent tagging, and proper class tracking are foundational.

### 3. Daily Discipline Beats Monthly Sprints
Closing the month is easy when you've been doing the work daily. "Real-time accounting" isn't magic—it's daily habits.

### 4. Dashboards Should Answer Questions, Not Raise Them
Bad dashboards dump data. Good dashboards highlight what matters. We designed every metric to answer a specific business question.

### 5. Fractional CFO Services Scale with You
Most growing practices can't afford (or don't need) a full-time CFO. Fractional CFO services give you executive-level financial expertise at a fraction of the cost—and the time savings pay for themselves.

## Is This You?

If you're running a multi-location practice (healthcare or otherwise) and struggling with:
- Delayed financial reporting
- No visibility into location-level profitability
- Manual, time-consuming month-end processes
- Lack of real-time dashboards for decision-making

...then you're leaving money on the table.

**The good news?** This isn't a technology problem. It's a process and structure problem—and it's completely fixable.

## What's Next?

We specialize in building financial operations that scale with growth. Whether you're running two locations or twenty, the principles are the same: **automate the routine, visualize the critical, and free your team to focus on strategy.**
