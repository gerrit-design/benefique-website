# December Financials: What to Review Before Year-End

December is more than holiday parties and PTO requests. For business owners, it's the last chance to make strategic moves that can significantly impact your tax bill and set you up for a strong start to the new year.

After 20+ years of closing books for South Florida businesses, I've seen the same pattern: business owners who take December seriously end up with cleaner books, lower tax bills, and better cash flow in Q1. Those who don't? They're scrambling in April wondering where all their profit went.

Here's exactly what you need to review before December 31st.

## 1. Profit & Loss: The Big Picture

**What to look for:**
- Compare December YTD to last year
- Identify unusual spikes or drops in revenue or expenses
- Check for one-time items that need reclassification

**Why it matters:** Your P&L tells the story of your year. Before tax prep begins, make sure it's telling the *right* story. We've found errors totaling $50K+ in year-end reviews simply because an expense got coded to the wrong account.

**Action item:** Run your P&L by month for the full year. Look for anything that seems off. That $12,000 "office supplies" charge in July? Probably should be equipment (and depreciated, not expensed).

## 2. Estimated Tax Payments: Avoid the Penalty

**What to look for:**
- Total estimated payments made so far
- Current year profit projection
- Gap between payments and actual tax liability

**Why it matters:** If you're going to owe more than $1,000 at tax time (or didn't pay 90% of this year's liability through estimates), you're looking at penalties. Making a January payment doesn't count—it needs to be postmarked by December 31st or January 15th (Q4).

**Action item:** Calculate your projected taxable income. Multiply by your effective tax rate. Compare to payments made. If there's a gap, make a Q4 estimated payment NOW.

**Pro tip:** If you had a big Q4 and didn't adjust your estimates, you're likely short. Better to overpay slightly than get hit with penalties.

## 3. Accounts Receivable: Collect Before Year-End

**What to look for:**
- Total AR balance
- Invoices over 60 days
- Customers with chronic late payments

**Why it matters:** Revenue is taxable in the year you earn it, even if you haven't been paid. But here's the kicker: if you collect that AR in December instead of January, you have the CASH to pay the taxes when they're due.

**Action item:** 
- Send reminder emails to everyone with open invoices
- Make phone calls for anything over 60 days
- Offer a small discount for payment before 12/31 if needed

**Real example:** One of our dental practice clients collected $47K in December AR that was sitting at 45+ days. That cash paid their Q1 estimated taxes without touching their line of credit.

## 4. Deductible Expenses: Accelerate or Defer

**What to look for:**
- Planned equipment purchases
- Recurring expenses you could prepay
- Employee bonuses or contributions

**Why it matters:** Cash-basis businesses can deduct expenses in the year they're paid, not when they're billed. If you had a profitable year, accelerating expenses into December reduces your taxable income.

**Action items:**
- **Buy that equipment:** If you were planning to buy computers, software, or equipment in Q1, buy it in December instead. Section 179 and bonus depreciation let you deduct the full amount this year.
- **Prepay expenses:** Prepay 2026 insurance, rent (up to 12 months), or maintenance contracts.
- **Max out retirement:** Make sure you've maxed SEP-IRA, Solo 401(k), or other retirement contributions.
- **Pay bonuses:** If you're paying employee bonuses, do it before 12/31 (even if checks clear in January).

**Caution:** Only do this if you're profitable and have the cash. Don't create a January cash crunch just to save on taxes.

## 5. Inventory & COGS: The Restaurant Surprise

**What to look for:**
- Physical inventory count vs. books
- Large inventory purchases in Q4
- COGS as a percentage of revenue

**Why it matters:** We see this with restaurants and product-based businesses: they buy a huge amount of inventory in December, expense it all, then wonder why January looks unprofitable.

**Action item:** Do a physical count. Compare to your books. Adjust for reality. If you bought $15K of inventory that's still on the shelf, that's NOT a December expense—it's an asset.

**Real example:** A client bought $22K in specialty food inventory in December for an event in February. Their P&L showed a loss for the month until we reclassified it properly. Accurate books matter.

## 6. Balance Sheet: Often Ignored, Always Important

**What to look for:**
- Loan balances match your statements
- Accumulated depreciation is correct
- Owner's equity isn't negative (and if it is, why?)

**Why it matters:** Your P&L gets all the attention, but your balance sheet tells the health story. Lenders look at it. Buyers look at it. You should too.

**Action item:** Reconcile every balance sheet account. If something doesn't make sense, fix it now—not in March when you're trying to file taxes.

## 7. Payroll Taxes: Don't Play Games

**What to look for:**
- All 941s filed on time
- All payroll tax deposits made
- W-2/1099 prep started

**Why it matters:** The IRS doesn't mess around with payroll taxes. Late deposits trigger penalties instantly. Missing 941s? Even worse.

**Action item:** 
- Verify all Q4 payroll taxes are deposited
- Start W-2 and 1099 prep now (due January 31st)
- Double-check contractor classification (employee vs. 1099)

**Horror story:** We onboarded a client who hadn't filed 941s for 18 months. Penalties and interest added $31K to their bill. Don't be that business.

## 8. Mileage & Auto Expenses: Document or Lose It

**What to look for:**
- Mileage log (if you're deducting mileage)
- Auto expenses (if you're deducting actual expenses)
- Business use percentage

**Why it matters:** The IRS *loves* to disallow auto expenses in audits. No mileage log? No deduction.

**Action item:** If you haven't tracked mileage all year, do your best to reconstruct it now from calendar appointments, receipts, GPS history, etc. Going forward, use MileIQ or similar.

## 9. Entity Structure: Is It Still Right?

**What to look for:**
- Current entity type (LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp)
- Whether you're leaving money on the table

**Why it matters:** If you're operating as an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship and you're profitable, you're likely paying too much in self-employment tax. S-Corp election could save $10K-$30K annually.

**Action item:** If your net profit is over $60K, talk to your CPA about S-Corp election for 2026. The deadline is March 15th for calendar-year businesses.

**Real example:** We converted a service-based business from sole prop to S-Corp. Tax savings: $18K/year. Setup and maintenance cost: $2K. ROI: massive.

## 10. Tax Planning Meeting: Book It Now

**What to look for:**
- Open slot on your CPA's calendar (spoiler: they're booked)

**Why it matters:** By January, your CPA is drowning in tax returns. December is when you can still have a strategic conversation about minimizing your tax bill.

**Action item:** Book a 30-minute call with your accountant THIS WEEK. Bring your projections. Ask: "What should I be doing before December 31st?"

If your CPA is too busy for a December tax planning call, it might be time to find a CPA who prioritizes strategy, not just compliance.
