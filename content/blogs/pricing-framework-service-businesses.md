# Why Your Service Business Is Leaving Money on the Table (And How to Fix It)

## The Silent Profit Killer

Your costs went up 15% last year. Your prices didn't.

That gap? It's coming straight out of your profit—and eventually, your ability to pay yourself, hire staff, or invest in growth.

This isn't theory. It's math. And if you're a healthcare practice or service-based business owner who hasn't raised prices in the past 12-18 months, you're likely losing thousands (or tens of thousands) in profit without realizing it.

**Real example:** A multi-location radiology practice we work with hadn't adjusted their contracted rates in 3 years. Meanwhile, their labor costs increased 20%, software subscriptions jumped 12%, and compliance requirements added $30K in annual overhead.

Result? Their net profit margin dropped from 18% to 11%—not because revenue declined, but because they didn't pass through cost increases.

## The Problem: Rising Costs Don't Wait for You to Get Comfortable

Between 2023-2026, healthcare and service businesses have faced:

- **Labor costs:** Up 15-25% (staff wages, benefits, recruiting)
- **Software/tech:** Up 10-15% (EMR, scheduling, billing platforms)
- **Compliance:** New regulations adding $20K-$50K annually
- **Marketing:** Ad costs up 30-40% (Google, Meta, local SEO)
- **Supplies:** Medical/office supplies up 8-12%

If your prices stayed flat while these costs increased, your margin got crushed. It's not a revenue problem—it's a pricing problem.

**Here's the reality:** Pricing is a math problem, not an emotional one. If direct costs go up and prices don't, your margin shrinks. Period.

## The Framework: How to Restore Profitability Without Losing Clients

### Step 1: Know Your Numbers (Most Practices Don't)

Before you can price correctly, you need to know what it actually costs to deliver your service.

**Calculate your true direct cost per service:**

- Internal labor (provider time + support staff)
- Contractors (locum radiologists, hygienists, specialists)
- Materials/supplies directly tied to delivery
- Software/platform costs per service
- Marketing cost per new patient/client

**Example (Radiology Practice):**
- Radiologist read time: $80/study
- Tech labor: $25/study
- PACS/software allocation: $10/study
- Supplies (contrast, etc.): $15/study
- **Total direct cost:** $130/study

If you're billing insurance $150/study, your gross margin is only 13%. After overhead (rent, admin, compliance), you might be break-even or negative.

**Action item:** Pull your last 3 months of Profit & Loss statements. Look at your COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) or direct labor costs. Are they increasing? By how much?

If your costs went up 10% but prices didn't, you just lost 10% of your margin.

### Step 2: Analyze Clients by Profitability (Not Just Revenue)

Not all clients are created equal. Some are profitable, low-maintenance, and pay on time. Others drain resources, negotiate constantly, and barely break even.

**The client profitability framework:**

Evaluate each major client/contract on:
- **Profitability:** Margin after direct costs
- **Retention:** How long they stay
- **Upsells:** Do they buy additional services?
- **Payment behavior:** Pay on time or constant collections?
- **Communication volume:** High-touch or low-maintenance?

Then color-code them:
- 🟢 **Green:** Profitable, low-drama, pay on time → Prioritize retention
- 🟡 **Yellow:** Breakeven or low margin, but potential to improve
- 🔴 **Red:** Unprofitable, high-maintenance, payment issues → Fix or fire

**Example (Dental Practice):**

**Green client:** Ortho patient ($5K treatment plan, pays monthly autopay, minimal missed appointments, referred 2 friends)

**Red client:** Hygiene-only patient who negotiates every visit, cancels often, demands same-day appointments, hasn't referred anyone in 5 years, barely profitable after staff time spent managing them.

**Strategy:**
- Raise prices on green clients incrementally (they already see value and are likely to accept)
- Raise prices more aggressively on red clients (either they become profitable or they leave—both outcomes are fine)
- Don't punish your best clients by doing blanket increases across the board

### Step 3: Communicate with Clarity and Confidence

Most business owners either:
1. Avoid raising prices because it feels awkward, or
2. Apologize profusely when they do, undermining the increase

**Here's the truth:** Clients don't expect you to operate at a loss. They expect you to deliver value and stay in business.

**What to communicate:**

**Subject: Important Update to Our Service Rates (Effective [Date])**

*"We're writing to let you know that our service rates will be increasing by [X%] effective [Date].*

*This adjustment reflects rising costs in labor, technology, and compliance that allow us to continue delivering the high-quality care you expect.*

*What's changing:*
- [Service A]: $X → $Y
- [Service B]: $X → $Y

*What's staying the same:*
- Same dedicated team
- Same 24-hour response time
- Same quality of care

*If you have questions, we're happy to discuss. Thank you for your continued trust in our practice."*

**What NOT to say:**
- "We're so sorry, but we have to raise prices..."
- "We hate to do this, but..."
- "We'll offer a discount if you prepay 6 months..."

Don't apologize for staying in business. Don't immediately offer discounts that erase the margin you just gained.

### Step 4: Use Incremental Increases, Not Drastic Jumps

**Common mistake:** Waiting 3 years, then raising prices 25% all at once.

**Result:** Clients freak out. Some leave. You lose revenue and confidence.

**Better approach:** Small, frequent increases.

**Example (Medical Practice):**

Instead of:
- 2021-2024: No price changes
- 2024: Raise prices 20% → Client revolt

Do this:
- Q1 2024: 5% increase
- Q3 2024: 5% increase
- Q1 2025: 5% increase
- Q3 2025: 5% increase

**Net result:** 20% total increase over 18 months, but each individual bump is small enough that clients barely notice.

**Real example:** A salon owner needed to raise haircut prices from $60 to $80 to restore profitability. Instead of jumping $20 overnight, she increased $5 every 4 months over a year. Retention stayed above 95%.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Profitability

### Mistake #1: Pricing by Gut Feel

You look at what competitors charge and match it. Or you pick a number that "feels right."

**Problem:** You have no idea if that number covers your actual costs or delivers acceptable margin.

**Fix:** Calculate your break-even per service. Never price below that. Ever.

---

### Mistake #2: Blanket Increases to All Clients

You send an email: *"Effective next month, all prices are increasing 10%."*

**Problem:** You just raised prices on your best, most profitable clients (who didn't need it) and your worst, unprofitable clients (who should have been increased 30%).

**Fix:** Segment increases based on profitability and relationship health. Green clients get modest increases. Red clients get aggressive increases (or get fired).

---

### Mistake #3: Apologizing for Price Increases

*"We're so sorry, we hate to do this, inflation is killing us, please don't leave..."*

**Problem:** You just told clients you're not confident in your value. They smell weakness and start shopping around.

**Fix:** Confident, clear communication. State the change. Explain the reason. Move on.

---

### Mistake #4: Waiting Too Long

You put it off for 18 months because it feels uncomfortable. Meanwhile, your profit bleeds out month after month.

**The cost of waiting:** A practice that delays a needed 10% increase for 12 months loses approximately $40K-$100K in profit (depending on revenue size). That's cash that should be in your bank account, funding growth or owner pay.

**Fix:** Review pricing quarterly. Make small adjustments as costs change. Treat it like a regular business decision, not an emotional crisis.

## The Bottom Line

**Pricing isn't about what you deserve. It's about math.**

If your costs went up and your prices didn't, you're subsidizing your clients with your own profit. That's not sustainable—and it's not smart.

**Start small. Be consistent. Communicate clearly. Track the results.**

Your business will thank you.
