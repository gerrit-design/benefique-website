# S-Corp Election: Is It Right for Your Business?

Last year, you made $150K as a consultant.  
This year, you'll pay $22,950 in self-employment taxes.

What if I told you that number could be $10,710 instead—*legally, permanently, and starting next month*?

If you're still operating as a sole proprietor or standard LLC, you're leaving $10K-$30K on the table every single year. Here's how to stop.

Let me be direct: **If your net profit is over $60,000 per year, S-Corp election will likely save you $10,000-$30,000 annually in self-employment taxes.**

That's not a typo. And it's not a loophole that's going away. It's how the tax code is designed to work.

Here's everything you need to know to make an informed decision.

## What Is S-Corp Election? Understanding S-Corporation Tax Status

First, let's clear up confusion:

**An S-Corp is not a business entity.** It's a **tax election**. You're still an LLC or corporation. You're just choosing to be taxed differently.

**Without S-Corp election:**
- Single-member LLC = Taxed as sole proprietor
- Multi-member LLC = Taxed as partnership
- Corporation = Taxed as C-Corp (double taxation)

**With S-Corp election:**
- Your LLC or corporation is taxed as an S-Corporation
- You become an employee of your own business
- You split your income between salary and distributions
- **Distributions are not subject to self-employment tax**

That last bullet is where the magic happens.

## S-Corp Tax Savings: How Much Can You Save?

Let's use real numbers.

### Scenario: LLC Taxed as Sole Proprietor

**Net profit:** $120,000  
**Self-employment tax (15.3%):** $16,956  
**Federal income tax (24% bracket):** ~$17,000  
**Total taxes:** ~$33,956

### Scenario: Same Business, S-Corp Election

**Reasonable salary:** $70,000  
**Distributions:** $50,000

**Payroll taxes on salary (15.3%):** $10,710  
**Federal income tax:** ~$17,000 (same)  
**Payroll taxes on distributions:** $0  
**Total taxes:** ~$27,710

**Savings: $6,246/year**

And that's conservative. Higher profits = higher savings.

## When Does S-Corp Election Make Sense?

### ✅ You're a Good Candidate If:

**1. Your net profit is consistently over $60K/year**  
Below $60K, the administrative costs and complexity often outweigh the tax savings.

**2. You're in a service-based business**  
Consultants, [healthcare providers](#), attorneys, accountants, designers, coaches—anyone selling expertise.

**3. You're already profitable and expect to stay that way**  
S-Corp doesn't make sense for startups burning cash or businesses with inconsistent income.

**4. You're willing to run payroll**  
You'll need to pay yourself via W-2, which means [payroll setup](#), quarterly 941s, and year-end W-2s.

**5. You want to reinvest profits or take distributions flexibly**  
S-Corps give you more control over how and when you take money out.

### ❌ S-Corp Might Not Be Right If:

**1. Your net profit is under $40K**  
The juice isn't worth the squeeze. Administrative costs eat up the savings.

**2. You plan to raise venture capital**  
VCs and many investors prefer C-Corps. S-Corps have shareholder restrictions.

**3. You want to retain earnings long-term**  
S-Corps are pass-through entities—you're taxed on profit whether you take it out or not.

**4. You have non-resident alien shareholders**  
S-Corps can only have U.S. citizens/residents as shareholders.

**5. You're not willing to handle additional compliance**  
S-Corps require payroll, reasonable salary justification, and proper documentation.

## The "Reasonable Salary" Question

Here's where business owners get nervous:

**The IRS requires you to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" before taking distributions.**

Too low of a salary = audit risk.  
Too high = you're not maximizing savings.

So what's "reasonable"?

**The IRS looks at:**
- What similar positions earn in your industry
- Your role and responsibilities in the business
- Time spent working
- Business profitability

**General guidelines:**
- **$50K-$70K** for most service-based businesses in the $100K-$150K profit range
- **$70K-$100K** if you're the primary revenue generator and profit is $200K+
- **$40K-$60K** if you have other team members doing the work and you're more of an owner/manager

**Quick test:** Could you hire someone to do your job for this salary? If yes, it's probably reasonable.

We've helped dozens of South Florida clients navigate IRS audits on reasonable compensation. With proper documentation, it's rarely an issue.

**Not sure what's reasonable for your situation?** We'll run your numbers in 15 minutes. [Book a free S-Corp consultation →](#)

## The Real Costs of S-Corp Status

Let's be transparent about what this actually costs:

### Setup Costs (One-Time)

**DIY Route:**
- Form 2553 (S-Corp election): Free
- State filings (varies): $0-$500

**With Professional Help:**
- EA or attorney setup: $500-$1,500
- Includes election filing, EIN, state registrations

### Ongoing Annual Costs

**Payroll:**
- [Payroll service](#) (Gusto, ADP, etc.): $500-$1,200/year
- Quarterly 941 filings: Included or $100-$200 if outsourced

**Tax Preparation:**
- S-Corp tax return (Form 1120-S): Add $800-$2,000 to your existing tax prep fee
- More complex than Schedule C, less complex than C-Corp

**Accounting:**
- Proper [bookkeeping](#) (separating salary vs. distributions): +$200-$500/year if outsourced
- Most businesses should already be doing this

**Total annual cost estimate: $1,500-$3,500**

**Break-even point:** You need to save at least $3,500/year in taxes for S-Corp to make sense.

At $60K net profit, you're saving ~$4,500. Worth it.  
At $100K net profit, you're saving ~$10,000. Clear value.  
At $200K+ net profit, you're saving $15K-$30K. No-brainer.

## The 20-Minute S-Corp Election (Or 20 Seconds If We Do It)

Look, the IRS makes this *sound* complicated. It's not. Here's the real process:

**If you already have an LLC:** File one form (2553). Takes 20 minutes. You're done.  
**If you're a sole prop:** Form an LLC first, then file 2553. Takes a week. Still simple.

Here's the breakdown:

### Step 1: Form Your Entity (Skip if you're already an LLC)

**What:** File LLC formation with your state  
**Cost:** $100-$500  
**Time:** 1-2 weeks  
**DIY or pro:** Either works (we charge $500 if you want us to handle it)

### Step 2: File Form 2553 with the IRS

This is *the* S-Corp election form. It's free, it's online, and it's shockingly simple for an IRS form.

**Critical deadline:** March 15th for current-year election.  
**Pro tip:** File in January/February. The IRS has been known to "lose" forms filed at the deadline.

### Step 3: Set Up Payroll

You're now an employee of your business. You need:
- Payroll service (Gusto, ADP, [QuickBooks Payroll](#))
- State unemployment insurance registration
- Workers' comp (if required in your state)

**How often to pay yourself:**
- Monthly is most common for small S-Corps
- Some do quarterly if profit is variable
- Must be consistent and documented

Need help with [payroll setup](#)? We handle everything for our clients.

### Step 4: Update Your Accounting

Separate accounts for:
- Owner salary (W-2 wages)
- Distributions (from retained earnings)
- Shareholder loans (if applicable)

Your bookkeeper or EA can help set this up. We include this in our [S-Corp setup package](#).

### Step 5: File Quarterly Payroll Taxes

Form 941 is due quarterly. Most payroll services handle this automatically.

**Don't skip this.** Missing 941s triggers IRS penalties fast.

## Common S-Corp Election Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: No Salary, Only Distributions

**The trap:** Taking only distributions to avoid payroll taxes

**Reality:** The IRS will reclassify distributions as salary and hit you with penalties, back taxes, and interest.

**Fix:** Pay yourself a reasonable salary BEFORE taking distributions.

### Mistake #2: Salary Too Low

**The trap:** "$30K salary, $120K distributions—I'm gaming the system!"

**Reality:** Audit risk. The IRS isn't stupid.

**Fix:** Use industry benchmarks. Document your reasoning. Err on the side of caution.

### Mistake #3: Not Running Payroll

**The trap:** "I'll just call it a salary but not actually do payroll."

**Reality:** That's not a salary. That's a distribution. No tax savings.

**Fix:** Actual W-2. Actual payroll taxes. Actual 941s.

### Mistake #4: Missing the Election Deadline

**The trap:** "I'll elect S-Corp in December for this year."

**Reality:** Too late. Deadline was March 15th.

**Fix:** File Form 2553 in January or February. Set a reminder.

### Mistake #5: Not Keeping Good Records

**The trap:** "I don't need to document anything."

**Reality:** In an audit, the burden of proof is on YOU.

**Fix:** Keep payroll records, board resolutions, shareholder meeting minutes (even if it's just you).

**Avoid these traps.** We'll handle the election, payroll, and compliance—so you just collect the savings. **→ [Book Your Strategy Call](https://www.benefique.com/apply)**

## Real Client Example: The Solo Dentist Who Saved $21K

**Client:** Solo dentist in private practice  
**Structure before:** Single-member LLC (taxed as sole prop)  
**Net profit:** $280,000/year

**Taxes before S-Corp:**
- Self-employment tax: $37,000  
- Income tax: ~$52,000  
- **Total: $89,000**

**After S-Corp election:**
- Reasonable salary: $150,000  
- Self-employment tax on salary: $22,950  
- Distributions: $130,000 (no SE tax)  
- Income tax: ~$52,000 (same)  
- **Total: $74,950**

**Annual savings: $24,050**

**S-Corp costs: $2,500/year**

**Net benefit: $21,550/year**

Over 10 years? **$215,000** in tax savings. That's a lake house. That's two kids' college funds. That's early retirement.

## What About LLCs Taxed as Partnerships?

If you have multiple owners, the math gets more complex but S-Corp often still makes sense.

**Key differences:**
- Multiple W-2s (one per owner/active participant)
- Distributions split according to ownership %
- More administrative complexity

**When it makes sense:**
- Combined net profit over $150K
- Owners actively involved in the business
- Clear ownership split and roles

We help several multi-owner practices manage S-Corp structures. It's doable, but you need clean books and good communication between partners. Learn more about our [multi-location accounting services](#).

## S-Corp vs. C-Corp vs. LLC: What's the Difference?

Quick comparison for those considering different entity structures:

| | S-Corp | C-Corp | LLC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tax treatment** | Pass-through (profit taxed once) | Double taxation (corporate + personal) | Pass-through (default) |
| **Shareholders** | Max 100, must be US citizens | Unlimited, can be foreign | N/A (members) |
| **Stock classes** | One class only | Multiple classes allowed | Flexible |
| **Best for** | Small business owners, service businesses | Startups raising VC, large corporations | Simple structure, flexibility |
| **Self-employment tax** | Only on salary | N/A (employees) | On all profit |

**Bottom line:** Unless you're raising venture capital or planning to go public, S-Corp is almost always better for profitable small business owners.

## Next Steps: Should You Make the Switch?

### Do This Today:

**1. Calculate your net profit**  
Look at your last full-year tax return. What was your Schedule C net profit (or LLC K-1 income)?

**2. Estimate your tax savings**  
- Multiply net profit by 15.3%
- Subtract reasonable salary × 15.3%
- Remaining amount = estimated savings

**3. Compare to costs**  
If savings > $5,000/year, it's probably worth it.

**4. Talk to your EA or tax professional**  
If they haven't brought up S-Corp and you're profitable, ask why not.

## FAQ: S-Corp Election

### What is S-Corp election?

S-Corp election is a tax filing (Form 2553) that allows your LLC or corporation to be taxed as an S-Corporation. This lets you split income between salary (subject to payroll taxes) and distributions (not subject to payroll taxes), typically saving $10K-$30K annually for profitable businesses.

### When should I elect S-Corp status?

Elect S-Corp when your net profit consistently exceeds $60K per year. File Form 2553 by March 15th for current-year election, or anytime during the prior year. The sooner you file, the sooner you start saving.

### How much does S-Corp election cost?

Annual costs are $1,500-$3,500 (payroll services, S-Corp tax return, bookkeeping). One-time setup is $500-$1,500 if using professional help. If you're saving $10K+ in taxes, it's worth it.

### What is a reasonable salary for S-Corp?

A reasonable salary matches what you could pay someone else to do your job. Typical ranges: $50K-$70K for $100K-$150K profit, $70K-$100K for $200K+ profit. Industry benchmarks and documentation are key.

### Can I elect S-Corp if I live in Florida?

Yes! Florida has no state income tax, making S-Corp even more valuable since there's no state tax impact on distributions. You still file federal S-Corp returns and pay federal payroll taxes.

### What's the deadline to elect S-Corp for 2026?

March 15, 2026 for calendar-year businesses. File earlier (January-February) to avoid processing delays. If you miss it, you're stuck with your current structure for the entire year.

## Final Thoughts

S-Corp election isn't right for everyone. But if you're a profitable small business owner, it's worth 30 minutes of analysis to find out if you could save $10K-$30K per year.
