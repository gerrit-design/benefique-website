# Multi-Location Financial Management

You opened a second location. Congratulations—you're growing!

Then the questions start:

- "Which location is actually profitable?"
- "Why is Location A doing great while Location B is bleeding cash?"
- "How do I allocate overhead between locations?"
- "Can I even trust these numbers?"

**If you can't answer these questions with confidence, you have a financial visibility problem.**

And it's costing you money.

After helping dozens of multi-location businesses (radiology practices, dental groups, restaurants, marine services) get their finances under control, I can tell you: **most multi-location operators are flying blind.**

They have *some* numbers. But they don't have clarity. And without clarity, they can't make good decisions.

Here's how to fix it.

---

## Why Multi-Location Finances Are Different

**Single location:**
- One set of books
- Clear revenue and expenses
- Easy to see profitability

**Multiple locations:**
- Consolidation challenges
- Shared expenses (how do you split them?)
- Location-specific performance hidden in combined financials
- Inter-location transactions
- Different management/staff at each location

**The trap:** You look at combined numbers and think everything's fine—then realize Location 3 has been losing money for 6 months.

---

## The 5 Core Challenges

### Challenge #1: Can't See Location-Level Profitability

**The problem:** Your P&L shows total company profit, but you can't break it down by location.

**Why it matters:** Location A might be profitable while Location B is dragging you down. Combined, you look okay—but you're making decisions blind.

**Example:** A 3-location dental practice showed $180K annual profit. When we broke it down:
- Location 1: +$220K
- Location 2: +$80K
- Location 3: -$120K

Location 3 was a cash furnace. But they didn't know because they only looked at combined numbers.

### Challenge #2: Shared Expenses Are Allocated Poorly (or Not at All)

**The problem:** You have corporate overhead (owner salary, central admin, marketing, software, rent for HQ) that benefits all locations. How do you split it?

**Why it matters:** If you don't allocate overhead properly, you don't know true location profitability.

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Not allocating overhead at all (makes each location look artificially profitable)
- ❌ Splitting evenly (unfair if locations are different sizes)
- ❌ Arbitrary allocation with no logic

**Better approach:** Allocate based on revenue percentage, headcount, or square footage.

### Challenge #3: Inconsistent Processes Between Locations

**The problem:** Location A codes expenses one way. Location B does it differently. Consolidation becomes a mess.

**Why it matters:** You can't compare apples to apples. Benchmarking is impossible.

**Example:** Location A codes all marketing as "Marketing." Location B splits it between "Advertising," "Promotions," and "Events." Good luck comparing.

### Challenge #4: Inter-Location Transactions

**The problem:** Locations share inventory, staff, or resources. How do you track who owes what?

**Why it matters:** Without proper tracking, you lose visibility and can't see true costs per location.

**Example:** A restaurant group shares centralized prep kitchen costs. If you don't allocate those costs, each location looks more profitable than it actually is.

### Challenge #5: Slow or Nonexistent Consolidation

**The problem:** Each location has its own books. Nobody consolidates them or it takes weeks.

**Why it matters:** You're making decisions based on outdated or incomplete data.

**Example:** CFO asks for consolidated financials on the 15th of the month. Bookkeeper delivers them on the 30th. By then, the data is worthless.

## The Solution: The Multi-Location Financial Stack

Here's the system that works for our clients:

### Layer 1: Entity Structure

**Decision:** Separate legal entities vs. divisions of one entity?

**Separate entities (LLCs for each location):**
- ✅ Liability protection
- ✅ Easier to sell individual locations
- ❌ More tax returns and compliance
- ❌ More complex consolidation

**Divisions/locations within one entity:**
- ✅ Simpler taxes (one return)
- ✅ Easier consolidation
- ❌ No liability firewall
- ❌ Can't sell just one location easily

**Our recommendation:** For most service-based multi-location businesses, separate LLCs under a parent holding company gives the best of both worlds.

### Layer 2: Accounting System Setup

**Option A: One QBO file, multiple locations/classes**

**How it works:**
- Single QuickBooks Online account
- Use "Locations" or "Classes" to tag every transaction
- Reports filtered by location

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to set up
- ✅ Simple consolidation (automatic)
- ✅ One subscription fee

**Cons:**
- ❌ Harder to sell a location (books are combined)
- ❌ Can get messy with complex inter-location transactions
- ❌ Limited customization per location

**Best for:** 2-3 locations under one legal entity.

**Option B: Separate QBO files, manual consolidation**

**How it works:**
- Each location has its own QBO file
- Roll up to consolidated spreadsheet or reporting tool

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clean separation
- ✅ Easier to sell individual locations
- ✅ More control per location

**Cons:**
- ❌ Multiple subscription fees
- ❌ Manual consolidation work
- ❌ Requires discipline to keep consistent

**Best for:** 3+ locations, separate legal entities, or complex operations.

**Option C: ERP or multi-entity accounting software**

**Examples:** NetSuite, Sage Intacct, Xero (with multi-entity setup)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Built for multi-location
- ✅ Automated consolidation
- ✅ Advanced reporting

**Cons:**
- ❌ Expensive
- ❌ Complex setup
- ❌ Overkill for most small businesses

**Best for:** 5+ locations or $10M+ revenue.

Here's the format we use for multi-location clients:

### Location-Specific Revenue

| Account | Loc 1 | Loc 2 | Loc 3 | Total |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Revenue** | $180K | $220K | $150K | $550K |

### Location-Specific Direct Costs

| Account | Loc 1 | Loc 2 | Loc 3 | Total |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Staff wages** | $45K | $60K | $50K | $155K |
| **Rent** | $8K | $12K | $7K | $27K |
| **Supplies** | $12K | $15K | $10K | $37K |
| **Utilities** | $2K | $3K | $2K | $7K |
| **Other direct** | $5K | $6K | $4K | $15K |
| **Total Direct Costs** | $72K | $96K | $73K | $241K |

### Location Gross Profit

| | Loc 1 | Loc 2 | Loc 3 | Total |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Gross Profit** | $108K | $124K | $77K | $309K |
| **Gross Margin** | 60% | 56% | 51% | 56% |

### Shared/Corporate Overhead (Allocated)

| Account | Loc 1 | Loc 2 | Loc 3 | Total |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Owner salary** | $18K | $22K | $15K | $55K |
| **Admin staff** | $10K | $12K | $8K | $30K |
| **Marketing (corporate)** | $6K | $7K | $5K | $18K |
| **Software/IT** | $3K | $4K | $3K | $10K |
| **Insurance** | $4K | $5K | $3K | $12K |
| **Other overhead** | $5K | $6K | $4K | $15K |
| **Total Overhead** | $46K | $56K | $38K | $140K |

*Allocated based on % of revenue*

### Location Net Profit

| | Loc 1 | Loc 2 | Loc 3 | Total |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Net Profit** | $62K | $68K | $39K | $169K |
| **Net Margin** | 34% | 31% | 26% | 31% |

---

## Key Insights from This Format

**1. Location 2 has the highest revenue AND highest gross profit**  
This is your star location.

**2. Location 3 has the lowest margin (26% vs. 34%)**  
Investigate why. Higher rent? Lower prices? Inefficient operations?

**3. Combined margin is 31%**  
But if you only looked at total numbers, you'd miss that Location 3 is lagging.

**4. Overhead is allocated fairly based on revenue %**  
If Location 1 generates 33% of revenue, it gets 33% of overhead.

---

## Overhead Allocation Methods

**Method 1: Revenue %**

**How it works:** Each location gets a % of overhead equal to its % of total revenue.

**Pros:** Simple, fair for revenue-based businesses  
**Cons:** Penalizes high-revenue locations even if they're efficient

**Best for:** Service businesses where revenue is the key driver

**Method 2: Headcount %**

**How it works:** Allocate based on number of employees per location.

**Pros:** Fair for labor-intensive businesses  
**Cons:** Ignores revenue differences

**Best for:** Businesses where labor is the primary cost

**Method 3: Square Footage %**

**How it works:** Allocate based on physical space.

**Pros:** Fair for rent-heavy businesses  
**Cons:** Ignores revenue and efficiency

**Best for:** Retail, restaurants, warehouses

**Method 4: Hybrid**

**How it works:** Split overhead into categories and allocate each differently:
- Marketing → Revenue %
- HR/Admin → Headcount %
- IT → Number of devices/users
- Owner salary → Revenue %

**Pros:** Most accurate  
**Cons:** More complex

**Best for:** Larger multi-location businesses

## Location-Level KPIs: What to Track

Beyond P&L, track these metrics per location:

### Financial KPIs

- **Revenue per location**
- **Gross profit per location**
- **Net profit per location**
- **Revenue per square foot** (retail/restaurants)
- **Revenue per employee**
- **Cost per sale** (customer acquisition cost)

### Operational KPIs

- **Number of customers/patients served**
- **Average transaction size**
- **Repeat customer rate**
- **Employee turnover rate**
- **Inventory turnover** (if applicable)

### Benchmarking

Compare locations to each other:
- Best performer vs. worst performer
- Revenue trends over time
- Cost structure differences

**Example dashboard:**

| Location | Revenue | Margin | Customers | Rev/Customer | Rev/Employee |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Loc 1 | $180K | 34% | 450 | $400 | $30K |
| Loc 2 | $220K | 31% | 520 | $423 | $31K |
| Loc 3 | $150K | 26% | 410 | $366 | $25K |

**Insight:** Location 3 has lower revenue per customer AND lower revenue per employee. This suggests either pricing is too low or efficiency is poor.

## Real Client Example: 3-Location Radiology Practice

**Client:** Insite Radiology (anonymized), 3 locations, $8M annual revenue

**Problem:**
- Combined financials looked fine
- Couldn't see profitability by location
- Month-end close took 3 weeks
- Couldn't answer: "Which location should we invest in?"

**What we did:**

**1. Restructured chart of accounts**
- Created consistent account codes across all 3 locations
- Tagged every transaction with location
- Separated direct costs from allocated overhead

**2. Built location-level P&Ls**
- Real-time dashboards showing each location's performance
- Weekly reports instead of waiting for month-end

**3. Allocated corporate overhead fairly**
- Owner/admin salaries split by revenue %
- IT costs split by number of devices
- Marketing split by patient volume

**Results:**
- Discovered Location 2 (Coconut Creek) was underperforming due to higher rent and lower patient volume
- Renegotiated lease, saving $18K/year
- Shifted marketing budget toward Location 1 and 3 (better ROI)
- Improved overall margins by 12%
- Month-end close: 3 weeks → 1 day

**Cost of solution:** Monthly CFO advisory + dashboard setup  
**Value:** $50K+ in identified savings + confident decision-making

## Common Multi-Location Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Opening Location 2 Before Location 1 Is Profitable

**The trap:** "We're growing! Let's expand!"

**Reality:** If Location 1 isn't solidly profitable and systematized, Location 2 will drain cash and attention.

**Fix:** Don't expand until Location 1 runs without you and generates consistent profit.

### Mistake #2: No Standard Operating Procedures

**The trap:** Each location does things their own way.

**Reality:** You can't scale chaos. Inconsistency kills profitability.

**Fix:** Document processes. Train consistently. Audit regularly.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Underperforming Locations Too Long

**The trap:** "Location 3 will turn around eventually."

**Reality:** 6 months becomes 2 years. You've burned $200K.

**Fix:** Set clear performance benchmarks. If a location isn't hitting them after 6-12 months, make tough decisions (new management, restructure, or close).

### Mistake #4: Not Tracking Inter-Location Transactions

**The trap:** Locations borrow inventory, share staff, or transfer funds without tracking.

**Reality:** Books become a mess. You don't know true costs.

**Fix:** Treat inter-location transactions like customer/vendor transactions. Track them properly.

### Mistake #5: Over-Allocating Overhead

**The trap:** Allocating so much overhead that no location looks profitable.

**Reality:** You lose motivation to grow.

**Fix:** Only allocate overhead that truly benefits all locations. Some corporate costs (like acquisition expenses) shouldn't be allocated.

## When to Expand to Location 3, 4, 5+

**You're ready when:**

✅ Location 1 is consistently profitable (12+ months)  
✅ Location 1 runs without daily owner involvement  
✅ You have documented SOPs for every key process  
✅ You have reliable financial reporting (current books, location-level P&Ls)  
✅ You have cash reserves (6 months operating expenses minimum)  
✅ You understand what makes Location 1 successful (and can replicate it)

**You're NOT ready when:**

❌ Location 1 still requires constant firefighting  
❌ You can't answer "Why is Location 1 profitable?"  
❌ Your books are a mess  
❌ You're relying on debt to fund expansion  
❌ You haven't tested your systems/processes thoroughly

**Pro tip:** Location 2 is the hardest. If you can successfully run 2 locations, scaling to 3+ is easier because you've figured out the systems.

**Fractional CFO services include:**
- Location-level financial reporting
- Overhead allocation strategy
- KPI dashboards
- Monthly financial reviews
- Expansion feasibility analysis
- Cash flow forecasting across locations
- Performance benchmarking

**Cost:** Fraction of a full-time CFO  
**Value:** Strategic visibility + confident decision-making

We work with several multi-location healthcare, service, and hospitality businesses across South Florida. This is what we do.
