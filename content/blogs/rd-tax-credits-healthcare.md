# R&D Tax Credits: Hidden Money for Healthcare Practices

When you hear "R&D tax credits," you probably think of tech startups and pharmaceutical companies.

You don't think of your radiology practice, dental group, or veterinary clinic.

**That's a mistake that's costing you tens of thousands of dollars.**

The Research & Development tax credit is one of the most valuable—and most overlooked—tax benefits available to healthcare practices. We've helped practices recover **$40,000-$120,000** in credits they didn't know they qualified for.

Here's what you need to know.

---

## What Are R&D Tax Credits?

The R&D tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your federal tax bill (and often state taxes too) for qualified research activities.

**Key benefits:**
- **Federal credit:** Up to 20% of qualified R&D expenses
- **State credits:** Florida doesn't have state income tax, but other states offer additional credits
- **Refundable:** Small businesses can use credits against payroll taxes
- **Retroactive:** You can amend returns up to 3 years back

**Translation:** If you spent $200K on qualified R&D activities, you could get a $40K tax credit. Not a deduction—a credit. Real money back.

## The Healthcare Misconception

**Common belief:** "We're not a research lab. We see patients. R&D doesn't apply to us."

**Reality:** The IRS defines "research" much more broadly than most people think.

You don't need white coats and test tubes. You need:
1. **Technical uncertainty** (trying to figure something out)
2. **Process of experimentation** (testing different approaches)
3. **Technological in nature** (based on hard sciences—biology, medicine, engineering)
4. **New or improved business component** (process, technique, formula, software)

Healthcare practices do this ALL THE TIME. They just don't document it.

## What Qualifies: Healthcare Examples

### Radiology Practices

**Qualifying activities:**
- Implementing new imaging protocols or techniques
- Testing and optimizing MRI/CT scanner settings for specific conditions
- Developing workflows to reduce patient exposure or scan times
- Integrating AI diagnostic tools and evaluating effectiveness
- Customizing image processing software
- Redesigning patient positioning techniques to improve image quality

**Example:** A multi-location radiology practice spent 6 months optimizing their MRI protocols to reduce scan times by 30% without losing image quality. They tested different sequences, consulted with radiologists, and documented outcomes.

**Result:** $62,000 in R&D credits claimed retroactively for 3 years.

### Dental Practices

**Qualifying activities:**
- Developing new treatment protocols (sedation, implant placement, etc.)
- Testing and refining CAD/CAM workflows
- Evaluating new materials or techniques (bonding agents, filling materials)
- Designing custom surgical guides or workflows
- Integrating digital imaging and treatment planning software
- Experimenting with sterilization or infection control processes

**Example:** A dental group spent significant time testing different implant placement techniques for patients with bone loss. They documented protocols, success rates, and modifications over 18 months.

**Result:** $38,000 in credits.

### Veterinary Clinics

**Qualifying activities:**
- Developing new surgical techniques for specific conditions
- Testing anesthesia protocols for exotic animals or high-risk patients
- Evaluating new diagnostic equipment or imaging techniques
- Creating custom treatment plans for rare conditions
- Experimenting with pharmaceutical compounding or dosing
- Designing improved clinic workflows or equipment setups

**Example:** A specialty vet clinic developed a new surgical approach for a complex orthopedic condition in dogs. They tested variations, documented outcomes, and refined the technique over time.

**Result:** $45,000 in credits.

### Multi-Specialty Medical Practices

**Qualifying activities:**
- Implementing electronic health records (EHR) systems with custom workflows
- Developing patient care protocols for chronic conditions
- Testing new telemedicine or remote monitoring technologies
- Creating custom medical devices or equipment modifications
- Experimenting with practice management software integrations
- Optimizing clinical workflows to reduce wait times or improve outcomes

## The 4-Part Test: Does Your Activity Qualify?

The IRS uses a 4-part test. ALL four must be met:

### 1. Permitted Purpose

**Your activity must aim to:**
- Create a new or improved business component (process, technique, formula, software, etc.)

**Healthcare translation:** New treatment protocol, improved workflow, optimized equipment setup, custom software integration.

✅ Yes: Developing a new patient intake workflow to reduce wait times  
❌ No: Buying new equipment off-the-shelf with no modification

### 2. Technical Uncertainty

**You must be trying to eliminate uncertainty about:**
- The appropriate design of the business component
- The capability or method for developing or improving it

**Healthcare translation:** You didn't know if your approach would work. You had to figure it out.

✅ Yes: Testing whether a new imaging protocol would work without sacrificing quality  
❌ No: Following a standard procedure from a textbook with no modification

### 3. Process of Experimentation

**You must:**
- Evaluate alternatives
- Test different approaches
- Refine based on results

**Healthcare translation:** You tried multiple options. You documented what worked and what didn't. You iterated.

✅ Yes: Tested 5 different sedation protocols, tracked outcomes, selected the best  
❌ No: Used the manufacturer's recommended settings with no testing

### 4. Technological in Nature

**The experimentation must:**
- Rely on principles of biology, medicine, engineering, computer science, or other hard sciences

**Healthcare translation:** This is healthcare. Almost everything qualifies here.

✅ Yes: Anything involving medical techniques, equipment optimization, or software  
❌ No: Marketing campaigns, administrative improvements unrelated to patient care

## What Expenses Qualify?

Once you identify qualifying activities, you need to calculate qualified research expenses (QREs).

### QREs Include:

**1. Wages**
- Salaries of employees performing or supervising R&D activities
- Doctors, nurses, technicians, IT staff, engineers
- Only the time spent on qualifying activities (not all wages)

**Example:** If your lead radiologist spent 20% of their time developing the new imaging protocol, 20% of their salary qualifies.

**2. Supplies**
- Materials consumed in the research process
- Testing materials, prototypes, trial materials
- Must be used up (not equipment)

**Example:** Materials used during the testing phase of a new dental material.

**3. Contract Research**
- 65% of amounts paid to third parties to perform R&D on your behalf
- Consultants, engineers, specialists hired for the project

**Example:** Paid a software developer to build a custom EHR integration? 65% qualifies.

**4. Computer Lease/Cloud Costs (if used for R&D)**
- Hosting, servers, software used specifically for qualifying activities

### What Doesn't Qualify:

❌ General overhead (rent, utilities, admin salaries)  
❌ Marketing or patient acquisition costs  
❌ After-the-fact documentation (must be during development)  
❌ Equipment purchases (these go through regular depreciation)

---

## How to Claim R&D Credits

### Step 1: Identify Qualifying Activities (Past 3 Years)

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Did we implement any new processes, protocols, or technologies?
- Did we test different approaches to solve a problem?
- Did we customize or modify equipment or software?
- Did we develop anything proprietary or unique?

**Pro tip:** Talk to your clinical staff. They're doing the work and often don't realize it qualifies.

### Step 2: Document Everything

The IRS wants **contemporaneous documentation**. This means documentation created DURING the activity, not after.

**What to gather:**
- Project notes, meeting minutes, protocols
- Test results, outcome tracking, iteration logs
- Emails discussing the project
- Before/after comparisons
- Time tracking (who worked on it, how long)
- Expense records (supplies, contractors, etc.)

**Don't have documentation?** You can still claim credits with reasonable reconstructions, but contemporaneous docs are stronger.

### Step 3: Calculate Qualified Expenses

Work with your CPA or an R&D credit specialist to:
- Identify employee time spent on qualifying activities
- Calculate wage expenses (salary + benefits × time %)
- Add supply costs and contractor fees
- Apply the appropriate credit rate (typically 7-10% for most taxpayers)

### Step 4: File Form 6765

This is the R&D credit claim form. It goes with your tax return.

**Options:**
- **Regular Credit Method:** Simpler, based on current-year spending minus a base amount
- **Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC):** Often better for healthcare practices with no prior R&D history

**Small business bonus:** If you have less than $5M in revenue and are less than 5 years old, you can apply credits against payroll taxes (up to $500K/year).

### Step 5: Amend Prior Years (If Applicable)

You can amend returns for the past 3 years to claim missed credits.

**Example:** If you qualified in 2023, 2024, and 2025 but never claimed, you can amend all three and get refunds.

## Real Client Example: Multi-Location Radiology Practice

**Client:** 3-location radiology practice, 12 radiologists, $8M annual revenue

**Qualifying activities (identified retroactively for 3 years):**
- Developed proprietary imaging protocols for specific sports injuries
- Integrated and customized AI diagnostic software
- Optimized scanner settings to reduce radiation exposure
- Built custom reporting system connecting to referring physicians' EHRs

**Qualified expenses:**
- Radiologist time: $320,000 (estimated 15% of annual wages over 3 years)
- IT staff time: $80,000
- Software consultants: $45,000 (65% of contractor fees)
- Supplies/testing: $12,000

**Total QREs:** $457,000  
**Credits claimed (3 years):** $91,400 (20% rate)

**Refund received:** $91,400

**Cost of R&D study:** $12,000

**Net benefit:** $79,400

That paid for a new MRI down payment.

## Common Objections (And Why They're Wrong)

### "We're too small."

**Wrong.** There's no revenue minimum. Small practices often have higher qualifying percentages because owners are hands-on.

### "We didn't keep good records."

**Partially true.** Contemporaneous docs are best, but you can reconstruct based on emails, calendars, and interviews. Not ideal, but workable.

### "The IRS will audit us."

**Unlikely.** R&D credits have lower audit rates than most assume. And if you're audited, good documentation = smooth process.

### "Our accountant never mentioned it."

**Common.** Many CPAs focus on compliance, not credits. R&D credits require specialized knowledge and extra work. If your CPA isn't bringing it up, ask why.

### "We already filed our taxes."

**Not a problem.** Amend. You have 3 years from the filing date to amend and claim missed credits.

---

## Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Not Tracking Time

**The problem:** You can't prove how much time staff spent on qualifying activities.

**The fix:** Start tracking now. For past years, reconstruct based on project timelines and interviews.

### Mistake #2: Over-claiming

**The problem:** Claiming routine activities as R&D. The IRS will disallow.

**The fix:** Be conservative. Only claim activities that truly meet the 4-part test.

### Mistake #3: DIY Without Expertise

**The problem:** R&D credit calculations are complex. Errors lead to missed money or IRS issues.

**The fix:** Work with a CPA or specialist who has healthcare R&D experience.

### Mistake #4: Not Documenting Prospectively

**The problem:** You're doing qualifying work now but not documenting it.

**The fix:** Start documenting today. Project logs, meeting notes, outcome tracking.

---

## How to Start Documenting for Future Years

**Set up a simple system:**

**1. Create a "Projects" log**
- What you're trying to accomplish
- Why it's uncertain (what you don't know)
- Different approaches you're testing

**2. Track time**
- Who's working on the project
- Roughly how much time they're spending

**3. Save communications**
- Emails about the project
- Meeting notes
- Test results and outcomes

**4. Document before/after**
- Baseline metrics (before)
- Results and improvements (after)

**5. Quarterly review**
- Every 3 months, review projects with your CPA
- Identify what might qualify
- Adjust documentation as needed

---

## Next Steps: Find Your Hidden Credits

### Do This Week:

**1. Review the last 3 years**  
What new processes, technologies, or protocols did you implement?

**2. Talk to your clinical staff**  
Ask: "What have we developed, tested, or optimized?"

**3. Gather documentation**  
Project notes, emails, timelines—anything that shows experimentation.

**4. Talk to your CPA**  
Ask: "Have you evaluated us for R&D credits?"

If the answer is "no" or "you don't qualify," get a second opinion.
