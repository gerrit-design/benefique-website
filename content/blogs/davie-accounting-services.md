# Davie Accounting Services for Healthcare Practices & SMBs

You need an accountant who understands your business—not a generic bookkeeper running someone else's playbook.

In Davie and South Florida, there's no shortage of accounting firms. But there's a massive gap between "filing taxes once a year" and "actually helping you make better business decisions."

We're different. Here's why.

## Why Most Davie Businesses Overpay Taxes (And How We Fix It)

**The typical story:**
- January rolls around, business owner panics
- Scrambles to gather receipts and bank statements for the past 12 months
- Hands everything to their accountant (or accountant's staff)
- Gets a tax bill they didn't anticipate
- Makes bad decisions in Q1 trying to recover

**Sound familiar?**

This happens because most accounting firms are **reactive**, not **proactive**. They file your taxes on deadline. That's it.

### Real-Time Accounting Changes Everything

Instead of playing catch-up every January, imagine knowing exactly where you stand **every month**.

Monthly close = You see:
- Profit/loss (actually accurate, not estimated)
- Cash runway (how long until you run out of cash?)
- Tax liability (what will you owe April 15th?)
- Decision-ready numbers (should you hire? Invest? Take a distribution?)

**For healthcare practices specifically:** Monthly closes reveal deduction opportunities nobody catches in annual reviews. Equipment purchases, CME, contractor costs, malpractice insurance—all of it gets optimized *when it matters*, not after the year is closed.

## The Davie Advantage: No State Income Tax

Florida has **zero state income tax**. Period.

For a healthcare practitioner making $250k+, that's worth $15,000-$25,000/year in savings compared to California or New York.

But here's what most accountants miss: **State tax planning is different in Florida.**

- S-corp elections have different math (no state tax drag)
- Retirement plan strategies change
- Entity structure gets reconsidered
- Contractor vs. employee decisions shift

We specialize in maximizing Florida's advantage for healthcare practices and SMBs. Generic accountants don't know the nuances.

## What Benefique Accounting Looks Like

### Monthly Close (Not Annual Catch-Up)

**Month 1:**
- All transactions categorized
- P&L statement (accurate)
- Cash position (real number)
- Tax liability projected for year

**Month 2-12:**
- Same process, trending
- You see seasonal patterns
- Identify problem areas early
- Make Q1/Q2/Q3 adjustments *that actually help*

### Quarterly Tax Planning Meeting

Every 90 days, we sit down and ask:
- Are we on track for our tax estimate?
- What deductions are we missing?
- Should we adjust compensation?
- Do we need to make estimated payments?
- Are there year-end strategies we can implement now?

**This is why you hire us.** Not for the filing. For the *decisions*.

### 24-Hour Response Time

You email with a question. You get an answer the same day (or next business day, tops).

Not "your request is in the queue," not "we'll get back to you in 2 weeks."

Actual response. By someone who knows your business.

### Healthcare Practice Specialization

We work with:
- **Doctors** (MDs, DOs, specialists)
- **Dentists**
- **Therapists** (PT, OT, speech)
- **Medical practices** (multi-doctor, partnerships)
- **Healthcare contractors** (locum tenens, per diem)

We understand:
- Professional liability insurance (deductible? Sometimes complicated)
- Medical equipment depreciation
- Continuing education (sometimes deductible, sometimes not)
- Malpractice insurance strategy
- Payroll + profits = income splitting opportunities
- Multi-doctor entity structures

Non-healthcare accountants miss 30-50% of these deductions.

## Real Example: Why Monthly Close Matters

**Dr. Johnson, Dentist**
- Revenue: $280k (practicing dentist)
- Staff: 2 hygienists, 1 admin
- Equipment: Recently upgraded chair ($35k)

### Old approach (annual filing):
- Runs practice all year
- November: Realizes huge tax bill coming
- December: Scrambles to buy more equipment to offset taxes
- January: Files, pays bill, frustrated

### Benefique approach:
- **February:** Monthly close shows $280k revenue, projects $95k taxable income
- **April:** After Q1, we see pattern: can plan Q2/Q3 strategy
- **June:** Quarterly meeting - we discuss S-corp election benefits ($18k+ tax savings)
- **August:** Payroll adjustment made mid-year (actually helps, not reactive)
- **October:** Year-end planning: equipment purchases already optimized
- **December:** Expected tax bill is $0 or small refund (no surprises)

**Difference:** $18,000 in tax savings + zero stress + better business decisions.

That's healthcare accounting done right.

## Healthcare Practice Success Stories

### Dr. Patterson (Dentist)
**Situation:** Solo dentist, $320k revenue, paid $85k in taxes last year

**What we found:**
- Missing medical equipment deduction ($12k)
- S-corp election would save $16k/year
- Payroll structure was suboptimal (eating into deductions)

**Result:** $28k tax savings first year, plus monthly visibility into cash flow (better staffing decisions)

---

### Therapy Practice (3 PTs)
**Situation:** Partnership, growing fast, terrible cash flow despite "profit"

**What we found:**
- A/R aging (insurance wasn't paying on time)
- Payroll was 62% of revenue (too high)
- No distinction between owner profits vs. compensation

**Result:** Fixed payroll structure, improved A/R collection, partnered on pricing strategy. Cash flow improved 40%, owners took home 35% more.

---

### Medical Practice (2-Doc)
**Situation:** One doctor wanted to exit, structure was simple LLC (nightmare for buyout)

**What we found:**
- Entity structure made exit nearly impossible
- No profit-sharing agreement
- Tax implications of buyout were huge

**Result:** Restructured to partnership, built exit agreement, exiting doctor left cleanly, staying doctor optimized tax position. Exit happened in 90 days vs. 18+ months with typical accounting.
