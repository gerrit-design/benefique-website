# Davie Accounting Services for Healthcare Practices & Service-Based Businesses

You need an accountant who understands your business—not a generic bookkeeper running someone else's playbook.

In Davie and South Florida, there's no shortage of accounting firms. But there's a massive gap between "filing taxes once a year" and "actually helping you make better business decisions."

Whether you're running a radiology practice, surgical center, dental office, veterinary clinic, pain clinic, law firm, marine services business, or IT services firm—the problem is the same: you can't improve what you can't see.

We're different. Here's why.

## Why Most Davie Businesses Overpay Taxes (And How We Fix It)

**The typical story:**
- January rolls around, owner panics
- Scrambles to gather receipts and bank statements for the past 12 months
- Hands everything to their accountant
- Gets a tax bill they didn't anticipate
- Makes reactive decisions in Q1 trying to recover

**Sound familiar?**

This happens because most accounting firms are **reactive**, not **proactive**. They file your taxes on deadline. That's it.

### Real-Time Accounting Changes Everything

Instead of playing catch-up every January, imagine knowing exactly where you stand **every month**.

**Monthly close means you see:**
- Profit/loss by location, department, service line, or job (not just top-level)
- Cash runway and working capital position
- Tax liability (what will you owe April 15th?)
- Owner distributions and profit allocation
- Decision-ready numbers (should you hire? Invest? Expand? Cut?)

**For healthcare practices:** Monthly closes reveal deduction and structuring opportunities nobody catches in annual reviews.

**For service-based businesses:** Monthly closes reveal true job profitability, cost issues, and operational inefficiencies you can't see with cash-basis accounting.

## The Davie Advantage: No State Income Tax

Florida has **zero state income tax**. Period.

For medical practices, construction companies, professional service firms, and any other multi-million dollar business, this is worth substantial tax savings compared to California or New York.

But here's what most accountants miss: **State tax planning is different in Florida.**

- S-corp elections have different math (no state tax drag)
- Retirement plan strategies change
- Multi-state practice/business considerations shift
- Contractor vs. W-2 classification affects federal and state differently

We specialize in maximizing Florida's advantage for healthcare practices, professional service groups, and service-based businesses. Generic accountants don't know the nuances.

## What Benefique Accounting Looks Like

![Monthly Close Process - Real-Time Financial Reporting](/images/blog/davie-monthly-close-process.jpg "Monthly accounting close: From transactions to P&L to decision-ready insights")

### Monthly Close (Not Annual Catch-Up)

**Month 1:**
- All transactions categorized and reconciled
- P&L statement by location/department/service line (accurate)
- Cash position and working capital trends
- Tax liability projected for year and by quarter

**Month 2-12:**
- Same process, visible trends across all months
- You see seasonal patterns and operational inefficiencies
- Identify problem areas early (unprofitable locations, high-cost centers, service lines)
- Make Q1/Q2/Q3 adjustments that actually improve results

### Quarterly Tax Planning Meeting

Every 90 days, we sit down and ask:
- Are we on track for our tax estimate and strategic goals?
- What deductions are we missing? What opportunities are we leaving on the table?
- Should we adjust partner compensation, owner draws, or distributions?
- Do we need to make estimated payments or adjust withholding?
- Are there year-end strategies we can implement now vs. scrambling in December?

**This is why you hire us.** Not for the filing. For the strategy.

### 24-Hour Response Time

You email with a question. You get an answer the same day (or next business day, tops).

Not "your request is in the queue," not "we'll get back to you in 2 weeks."

**Actual response. By someone who knows your business and your numbers.**

### The Foundation: Strong, Accurate, Transparent Accounting

This is what separates us:

- **Real-time access** to accurate financial data (24/7)
- **Accrual-based reporting** (not cash basis disguising operational truth)
- **Operational visibility** by service line, location, profit center, job profitability
- **Fast response** to questions that drive business decisions

Accrual accounting is additional work. But it delivers. It shows where money actually goes, not just when it hits the bank account. Without it, you can't improve your cash flow.

### Healthcare & Service Business Specialization

![Healthcare Practices & Service Businesses Served by Benefique](/images/blog/davie-specialization-healthcare-services.jpg "Radiology, Surgery, Dental, Vet, Pain Clinics, Law Firms, Marine Services, IT Services")

**Healthcare:**
- **Radiology practices** (diagnostic, interventional, multispecialty)
- **Surgical centers** (orthopedic, general surgery, specialty procedures)
- **Dental practices** (single location, multi-location groups, specialty)
- **Veterinary practices** (general, specialty, emergency)
- **Pain management clinics** (interventional pain, rehabilitation)

**Service-Based Businesses:**
- **Law firms** (solo, partnerships, multi-office)
- **Marine services** (charter, maintenance, operations, multi-location)
- **IT services** (managed services, consulting, development, staffing)

**We understand both sectors:**

**Healthcare specifics:** Malpractice insurance strategy, Medical equipment depreciation/leasing, Physician compensation plans, Partnership structures, Multi-location clinic operations

**Service Business specifics:** Service line profitability analysis, Client profitability tracking, Labor cost management, Billable hour optimization, Professional liability insurance, Partnership and equity structures, Multi-office operations

**Generic accountants miss 40-60% of these opportunities.**

## Real Examples: Why Monthly Close Matters

![Before & After: From Reactive Annual Accounting to Proactive Monthly Planning](/images/blog/davie-before-after-accounting.jpg "Traditional annual accounting vs. Benefique's monthly close approach: visibility, strategy, and control")

### Healthcare Example: The Surgical Practice

**The problem:** Running the practice all year without visibility into profitability. November: massive tax bill incoming. December: scrambling for last-minute equipment purchases to offset taxes. January: files, pays huge bill, cash flow strained for Q1.

**The old approach (annual filing):**
- Basic bookkeeping
- Annual tax filing
- No visibility into profitability per doctor
- No understanding of operational efficiency
- Reactive, not strategic

**The Benefique approach:**

We implemented monthly closes with accrual-based operational reporting.

Now they see:
- **Month 1:** True revenue and expense breakdown
- **Month 2-3:** Profitability by doctor and location. Operational issues become visible
- **Quarter 1 meeting:** Strategic tax planning discussion based on real data
- **Mid-year:** Profit distributions adjusted based on actual performance
- **Year-end:** Expected tax liability known. Partners can plan strategically instead of reacting

**The difference:** Real visibility into operations + proactive tax planning + informed business decisions.

### Service Business Example: The IT Services Firm

**The problem:** Growing fast, multiple service lines (managed services, consulting, development), but zero visibility into profitability by service. Owner couldn't answer: Which services make money? Which are money-losers? Is labor allocated efficiently? Which clients are actually profitable?

Owner was guessing on pricing and client mix. Cash flow was terrible despite "good revenue."

**The old approach (cash-basis bookkeeping):**
- Transactions recorded when money moves
- Annual tax filing
- No service line profitability visibility
- No understanding of which offerings/clients are actually profitable
- Owner making pricing/service decisions blind

**The Benefique approach:**

We implemented proper accounting fundamentals:
- Service line costing (profitability by service offering, not just overall)
- Accrual accounting (real expenses, not just cash flow)
- Operational reporting (labor rates, billable hours, service margins)

**Result:** Owner could see which services were profitable. Adjusted pricing mid-year. Optimized staffing allocation. Cut unprofitable service lines. Focused on high-margin offerings. Cash flow improved dramatically without new business—just better decisions based on real data.

**The difference:** Operational improvements without generating new revenue. Just better accounting fundamentals producing better financial information, driving better decisions.

### Another Healthcare Example: The Veterinary Practice

**The problem:** Basic bookkeeping, owner couldn't answer: Which services are actually profitable? Where are expenses going? Why are margins tightening despite good revenue?

Owner was flying blind.

**What we did:**

Implemented proper accounting fundamentals:
- A/P system (proper invoice management, early-pay discounts)
- Accrual accounting (actual expense tracking, not cash illusion)
- Operational reporting (profitability by service line)

**Result:** Owner could now see which services made money and which drained margin. Made mid-year pricing adjustments. Cut unprofitable services. Optimized staffing based on actual data.

Operational improvements happened **without generating a single extra dollar in revenue.** Just better accounting fundamentals.

---

### Partnership Transition Example: The Medical Practice

**The problem:** One partner wanted to retire. Outdated entity structure, no buy-sell agreement, no clear valuation framework. Senior partner risked losing value. Remaining partners' tax position would be destroyed.

**What we did:**
- Restructured to strategic partnership with buy-sell agreement
- Optimized entity structure for tax efficiency
- Planned the transition with proper timing and financing

**Result:** Clean transition. Senior partner left with full value + tax efficiency. Remaining partners' positions optimized.
